<b>A:</b> My grandma bought me some chocolates yesterday.<br /><b>B:</b> That is an impressive-looking box.<br /><b>A:</b> She said they were imported chocolates.<br /><b>B:</b> What does that mean?<br /><b>A:</b> I don't know, but it sounds impressive.<br /><b>B:</b> I think it means that they come from another country.<br /><b>A:</b> Would people go through that much trouble for candy?<br /><b>B:</b> Chocolate is considered a delicacy in some places.<br /><b>A:</b> It's ironic that it's almost worthless here.<br /><b>B:</b> Have you tried it yet?<br /><b>A:</b> Yes! It's delicious!<br /><b>B:</b> Well, that's imported chocolate for you!
<b>A:</b> What a delicious meal!<br /><b>B:</b> Don't stick your chopsticks in the rice like that!<br /><b>A:</b> What's wrong with it?<br /><b>B:</b> It's very bad manners.<br /><b>A:</b> Oh. I didn't know that.<br /><b>B:</b> You also shouldn't hold them in your mouth.<br /><b>A:</b> Where should I put them, then?<br /><b>B:</b> Just lay them neatly across your plate.<br /><b>A:</b> Chinese restaurants have a lot of rules!<br /><b>B:</b> Are you kidding? Fancy restaurants have three forks!<br /><b>A:</b> Never mind, I prefer two sticks to three forks!<br /><b>B:</b> Definitely! So mind your manners, please!
<b>A:</b> I'm making the food for the party tomorrow.<br /><b>B:</b> I heard you are a fantastic cook!<br /><b>A:</b> Thank you! I do my best.<br /><b>B:</b> Do you have everything you need?<br /><b>A:</b> I just need a few more items.<br /><b>B:</b> Vegetables are so expensive.<br /><b>A:</b> It's not so bad when they're not charged by the pound.<br /><b>B:</b> What about when you need a lot of one kind?<br /><b>A:</b> It's usually fine. Except I always buy too much garlic.<br /><b>B:</b> It's because the packages sell five heads instead of one.<br /><b>A:</b> I can never use all the garlic, and it goes bad.<br /><b>B:</b> Well, at least your house will be safe from vampires.
<b>A:</b> I get so hungry during the day!<br /><b>B:</b> That's not good; you should eat more.<br /><b>A:</b> Maybe I'll start taking snacks to work.<br /><b>B:</b> You can store them in the cafeteria fridge.<br /><b>A:</b> I'm afraid others will eat them, though.<br /><b>B:</b> You know, you might have a point.<br /><b>A:</b> I could write my name on the containers.<br /><b>B:</b> That's a good solution!<br /><b>A:</b> What kinds of things should I take, though?<br /><b>B:</b> You can wake up early and make lunch.<br /><b>A:</b> You know, maybe it's not worth all the effort.<br /><b>B:</b> You mean you don't want to give up your sleep!
<b>A:</b> I am so hungry.<br /><b>B:</b> Why don't you heat up a TV dinner?<br /><b>A:</b> I'm tired of eating frozen food!<br /><b>B:</b> It's not frozen once you heat it up.<br /><b>A:</b> You know what I mean!<br /><b>B:</b> Do you want to order a pizza?<br /><b>A:</b> We had pizza two days ago!<br /><b>B:</b> We may still have leftovers.<br /><b>A:</b> Can we go get take-out?<br /><b>B:</b> Only if you do the driving.<br /><b>A:</b> On second thought, I'll heat up the TV dinners.<br /><b>B:</b> You're the laziest person I know.
<b>A:</b> Tomatoes are so strange.<br /><b>B:</b> What's so weird about them?<br /><b>A:</b> My dad made a cake with them yesterday.<br /><b>B:</b> That's a little unusual, I guess.<br /><b>A:</b> Also, we eat them in salads all the time!<br /><b>B:</b> Why is this so amazing?<br /><b>A:</b> You don't usually use vegetables in desserts.<br /><b>B:</b> Tomatoes are a fruit.<br /><b>A:</b> That's like saying strawberries are not really berries!<br /><b>B:</b> Actually, they're not.<br /><b>A:</b> I feel like I've been lied to all my life!<br /><b>B:</b> Well, at least you can use them both in salads.
<b>A:</b> Do you want to get some ice cream?<br /><b>B:</b> Ice cream is really fattening.<br /><b>A:</b> All desserts are fattening.<br /><b>B:</b> Why don't we just eat some yogurt?<br /><b>A:</b> I wanted something cooler.<br /><b>B:</b> Haven't you ever heard of frozen yogurt?<br /><b>A:</b> I don't think that's really yogurt.<br /><b>B:</b> Is it ice cream, then?<br /><b>A:</b> I think it's healthier than ice cream.<br /><b>B:</b> It tastes good, and that's all I care about.<br /><b>A:</b> Well then, let's get some frozen yogurt.<br /><b>B:</b> Alright! I just don't know where to buy it.
<b>A:</b> What's the white stuff on your food?<br /><b>B:</b> It's sour cream. Want to try some?<br /><b>A:</b> I don't think so! It sounds gross.<br /><b>B:</b> It's not really sour.<br /><b>A:</b> Why is it called sour cream, then?<br /><b>B:</b> I think it's because they let the milk go sour to make it.<br /><b>A:</b> You're eating sour milk? Yuk!<br /><b>B:</b> Cheese is made in a similar way.<br /><b>A:</b> I thought cheese was made with bacteria.<br /><b>B:</b> Of course! Bacteria cause milk to go sour.<br /><b>A:</b> Dairy products are so strange.<br /><b>B:</b> Even so, I think they're delicious!
<b>A:</b> Why do they call this bubble tea?<br /><b>B:</b> I think it's because of the balls on the bottom.<br /><b>A:</b> They don't look like bubbles to me.<br /><b>B:</b> I told my sister they were frog eggs.<br /><b>A:</b> Did she believe you?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes. She started crying.<br /><b>A:</b> Why was she crying?<br /><b>B:</b> She said I was mean for eating baby frogs.<br /><b>A:</b> I agree with your sister; you're pretty mean.<br /><b>B:</b> It was just a bit of fun.<br /><b>A:</b> Well, did you know they're really fish eyes?<br /><b>B:</b> You're definitely not funny.
<b>A:</b> I wish I could touch the clouds.<br /><b>B:</b> I bet they would be soft like cotton candy.<br /><b>A:</b> Maybe they're made of cotton candy.<br /><b>B:</b> That's impossible!<br /><b>A:</b> Well, they're both fluffy.<br /><b>B:</b> That's all they have in common.<br /><b>A:</b> Both clouds and cotton candy dissolve with water.<br /><b>B:</b> Clouds don't dissolve with water!<br /><b>A:</b> Then why do they disappear after it rains?<br /><b>B:</b> That's actually a good observation.<br /><b>A:</b> I never want to try white cotton candy, though.<br /><b>B:</b> Me neither! I imagine it will taste like mint.
<b>A:</b> Don't put your cup noodles in the microwave!<br /><b>B:</b> Why not? They're better this way.<br /><b>A:</b> The styrofoam will melt and get in your food!<br /><b>B:</b> How am I supposed to heat it, then?<br /><b>A:</b> Heat the water and then pour it in.<br /><b>B:</b> It seems like so much more work, though.<br /><b>A:</b> It's worth it to be healthier!<br /><b>B:</b> You're right. It takes longer, though.<br /><b>A:</b> It'll take even longer if you keep complaining!<br /><b>B:</b> Okay, okay. I'll heat the water now.<br /><b>A:</b> Don't heat it for too long or you'll burn yourself.<br /><b>B:</b> I think I'll just eat them raw as a snack.
<b>A:</b> Do you have any chewing gum?<br /><b>B:</b> I don't have any, sorry.<br /><b>A:</b> What are you chewing on, then?<br /><b>B:</b> It's a piece of paper.<br /><b>A:</b> Do you know how dirty paper is?<br /><b>B:</b> It was a brand new sheet.<br /><b>A:</b> Why are you chewing it, though?<br /><b>B:</b> I forgot to buy gum, so I'm chewing paper.<br /><b>A:</b> What if you get a paper cut on your tongue?<br /><b>B:</b> I really don't think that will happen.<br /><b>A:</b> I still say it's a bad idea.<br /><b>B:</b> But at least I'm chewing something.
<b>A:</b> I love putting bacon in everything I cook.<br /><b>B:</b> It is a delicious food!<br /><b>A:</b> Did you know you can even put it in chocolate?<br /><b>B:</b> That's amazing!<br /><b>A:</b> It tastes wonderful! They're my two favorite things.<br /><b>B:</b> I heard bacon is actually bad for you, though.<br /><b>A:</b> How can something so delicious be bad?<br /><b>B:</b> It makes it harder to pump blood through your body.<br /><b>A:</b> That sounds dangerous!<br /><b>B:</b> I heard it can really shorten your life.<br /><b>A:</b> I'd rather live a short life happily eating bacon.<br /><b>B:</b> I think you need to work on your priorities.
<b>A:</b> Tomorrow is my son's birthday!<br /><b>B:</b> Are you going to bake him a cake?<br /><b>A:</b> I was thinking about it.<br /><b>B:</b> What kind were you considering?<br /><b>A:</b> That's what I'm not sure about.<br /><b>B:</b> Well, all kids love chocolate!<br /><b>A:</b> That's true, but it has a lot of sugar!<br /><b>B:</b> Why don't you make it plain vanilla?<br /><b>A:</b> I don't think the kids will eat a plain cake.<br /><b>B:</b> Then mix them and make chocolate swirl cake.<br /><b>A:</b> That's an amazing idea!<br /><b>B:</b> Another good idea is to let me lick the frosting bowl.
<b>A:</b> Why are some apples green and others red?<br /><b>B:</b> Won't the green ones turn red later?<br /><b>A:</b> No, I think they will always stay green.<br /><b>B:</b> Then they're just different kinds of apples.<br /><b>A:</b> But what makes them different?<br /><b>B:</b> Their genetics, I guess.<br /><b>A:</b> What if a long time ago someone colored apples red?<br /><b>B:</b> Then why are there green ones?<br /><b>A:</b> Because the painter made a mistake.<br /><b>B:</b> What do you think happened to that painter?<br /><b>A:</b> The apple queen probably chopped off his head.<br /><b>B:</b> I think you've seen Alice in Wonderland too many times.
<b>A:</b> The fish and chips dish looks delicious!<br /><b>B:</b> Do they let you choose the chips you want?<br /><b>A:</b> Maybe they're just salted potato chips.<br /><b>B:</b> The picture on the menu shows French fries.<br /><b>A:</b> Maybe that's an alternate choice.<br /><b>B:</b> I don't think so. No other chips are listed.<br /><b>A:</b> Do you think maybe the French fries are the chips?<br /><b>B:</b> Maybe. They're both made from potatoes.<br /><b>A:</b> This is a very confusing menu.<br /><b>B:</b> I agree. They must get a lot of complaints!<br /><b>A:</b> Oh well. You can have the chips.<br /><b>B:</b> I think you mean French fries.
<b>A:</b> James, eat your candy after dinner, please.<br /><b>B:</b> I just want to eat a little now.<br /><b>A:</b> You'll spoil your dinner!<br /><b>B:</b> My food won't rot if I eat a little candy.<br /><b>A:</b> What do you mean?<br /><b>B:</b> When food spoils, it goes bad. My food won't go bad.<br /><b>A:</b> It won't rot, but it won't taste the same, either.<br /><b>B:</b> Why won't it taste the same?<br /><b>A:</b> Well, if you eat the candy now, it will stay in your mouth.<br /><b>B:</b> I guess so. Why is that bad?<br /><b>A:</b> I don't think you want blueberry-flavored mashed potatoes!<br /><b>B:</b> You're right, I don't! I'll eat the candy later.
<b>A:</b> What is in this can?<br /><b>B:</b> I don't know; it doesn't have a label.<br /><b>A:</b> It looks like a corned beef can.<br /><b>B:</b> Well then, open it and we'll cook it!<br /><b>A:</b> It smells a little strange.<br /><b>B:</b> Maybe it went bad.<br /><b>A:</b> Why is the dog so excited?<br /><b>B:</b> Dogs love meat, so he can probably smell it.<br /><b>A:</b> Wait a minute, I think I know what this is!<br /><b>B:</b> What do you think it is?<br /><b>A:</b> It's the dog's canned dog food!<br /><b>B:</b> We're so lucky he discovered that before we did!
<b>A:</b> Let's go get lunch!<br /><b>B:</b> Where do you want to go?<br /><b>A:</b> Let's try that new restaurant down the street.<br /><b>B:</b> Only if you're treating!<br /><b>A:</b> I think it's your turn to pay the bill.<br /><b>B:</b> I paid it last time!<br /><b>A:</b> I think you're wrong.<br /><b>B:</b> It's an expensive restaurant.<br /><b>A:</b> I really want to try it, though!<br /><b>B:</b> If you want to go in, we'll pay separate bills.<br /><b>A:</b> That sounds fine to me!<br /><b>B:</b> Maybe we should do that more often.
<b>A:</b> There are so many different kinds of berries!<br /><b>B:</b> I can't tell some of them apart.<br /><b>A:</b> Me, neither! It is a difficult task.<br /><b>B:</b> Raspberries and blackberries have the same shape!<br /><b>A:</b> Just remember that raspberries are red.<br /><b>B:</b> Then why is raspberry candy always colored blue?<br /><b>A:</b> I think that's because cherry flavor is already red.<br /><b>B:</b> Blueberries are even more confusing!<br /><b>A:</b> Why? They're the blue ones.<br /><b>B:</b> Well, when you mash them, they look purple.<br /><b>A:</b> I don't think anyone eats mashed blueberries.<br /><b>B:</b> It's easier to eat them all in a pie! Then they all taste good together.
<b>A:</b> This is the most amazing smoothie ever!<br /><b>B:</b> What is so amazing about it?<br /><b>A:</b> It's made with a fruit humans invented!<br /><b>B:</b> How did humans invent a fruit?<br /><b>A:</b> I think the process is called cross-breeding.<br /><b>B:</b> That's amazing! What is the fruit called?<br /><b>A:</b> The name is a little uncreative.<br /><b>B:</b> Oh? Tell it to me.<br /><b>A:</b> It's a strawberry-banana!<br /><b>B:</b> You mean you got excited over a strawberry-banana<br />smoothie?<br /><b>A:</b> Wasn't making two fruits into one a great idea?<br /><b>B:</b> I think you misunderstood this whole situation.
<b>A:</b> I love your blue bag.<br /><b>B:</b> Thank you, I just bought it.<br /><b>A:</b> It looks very expensive.<br /><b>B:</b> It really wasn't. I bought it used online.<br /><b>A:</b> It looks brand new!<br /><b>B:</b> I know, and I saved $200.<br /><b>A:</b> Wow, I wonder why they didn't want it anymore.<br /><b>B:</b> I don't care. As long as it's cheap, I'll take it.<br /><b>A:</b> Do you think I could find one online too?<br /><b>B:</b> You probably could. They have everything online nowadays.<br /><b>A:</b> That's true. I'm going to go look now.<br /><b>B:</b> Good luck!
<b>A:</b> Where are you going?<br /><b>B:</b> I'm going to buy some flowers for Valentine's Day.<br /><b>A:</b> Who are the flowers for?<br /><b>B:</b> My mom, my sister, and my girlfriend.<br /><b>A:</b> Wow, you are very thoughtful.<br /><b>B:</b> I don't really know which flowers to buy, though.<br /><b>A:</b> Well, for your girlfriend, something romantic.<br /><b>B:</b> Red roses, of course.<br /><b>A:</b> For your mother, something that smells nice.<br /><b>B:</b> Carnations! She loves carnations.<br /><b>A:</b> And for your sister?<br /><b>B:</b> I'll buy her some pink roses. Thanks for your help!
<b>A:</b> Excuse me, Miss?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes?<br /><b>A:</b> Can I ask for your opinion on something?<br /><b>B:</b> Sure, what can I help you with?<br /><b>A:</b> Do you think I would look better in the blue or the red dress?<br /><b>B:</b> I don't think either one is good on you.<br /><b>A:</b> Then what should I do?<br /><b>B:</b> I think you should try on the yellow dress.<br /><b>A:</b> But I hate the color yellow.<br /><b>B:</b> Then maybe the purple dress would look nice, too.<br /><b>A:</b> I don't like purple, either.<br /><b>B:</b> Then I don't know how to help you.<br /><b>A:</b> Okay, thanks for your opinion anyway.
<b>A:</b> Are you interested in buying this bike?<br /><b>B:</b> That thing? I don't think so.<br /><b>A:</b> I assure you, it is a wonderful sale.<br /><b>B:</b> It looks rusted.<br /><b>A:</b> That can be fixed with a light coat of paint.<br /><b>B:</b> The chain looks old.<br /><b>A:</b> Just oil it a little, and it will be good as new!<br /><b>B:</b> The seat is uncomfortable.<br /><b>A:</b> All great bikes have high seats like this.<br /><b>B:</b> Well, how much are you asking for it?<br /><b>A:</b> For this fantastic find, only $140.<br /><b>B:</b> No way! If it's so valuable, sell it to the museum!
<b>A:</b> Can you help me?<br /><b>B:</b> Maybe I can.<br /><b>A:</b> I need this dress in a size eight.<br /><b>B:</b> If it's not on the rack, we don't have it.<br /><b>A:</b> Can you just check for me?<br /><b>B:</b> We don't have that dress in a size eight.<br /><b>A:</b> But you didn't even check!<br /><b>B:</b> Look, I'm really tired.<br /><b>A:</b> I think you mean lazy.<br /><b>B:</b> Can you ask another employee?<br /><b>A:</b> I want to talk to your manager.<br /><b>B:</b> No! I'll go find the dress.
<b>A:</b> Excuse me, I'd like your opinion on something.<br /><b>B:</b> Of course, sir. How may I help you?<br /><b>A:</b> I want to buy my wife a new scarf.<br /><b>B:</b> That is very thoughtful of you!<br /><b>A:</b> Her favorite color is blue, so I chose blue scarves.<br /><b>B:</b> What do you need me to do?<br /><b>A:</b> Well, I was wondering which scarf was the prettiest.<br /><b>B:</b> I see. Well, this one seems a little too dark.<br /><b>A:</b> What about this one?<br /><b>B:</b> Maybe something with a nicer pattern.<br /><b>A:</b> Is this one alright?<br /><b>B:</b> That one is perfect! I'm sure she'll love it.
<b>A:</b> Does this hat match my suit?<br /><b>B:</b> Well, it's the same color.<br /><b>A:</b> That's good enough for me.<br /><b>B:</b> Are you going to a dinner party?<br /><b>A:</b> No, I'm going to a job interview.<br /><b>B:</b> Then maybe you should wear a tie.<br /><b>A:</b> That's a good idea.<br /><b>B:</b> Also, I would not wear the hat if I were you.<br /><b>A:</b> Why not? It matches well.<br /><b>B:</b> You look like a mobster from the movies!<br /><b>A:</b> Don't hats make you look more professional?<br /><b>B:</b> Only if you're applying to be a hit-man.
<b>A:</b> I want to buy this, but $40 is too expensive.<br /><b>B:</b> It is a high-quality item, and worth every penny.<br /><b>A:</b> It looks a little bit dirty.<br /><b>B:</b> It is just dusty from being on the shelf.<br /><b>A:</b> If no one has bought it, it can't be so valuable.<br /><b>B:</b> It is my last one because I almost sold out.<br /><b>A:</b> I'll buy it if you cut the price in half.<br /><b>B:</b> That is too cheap! I'll make no money.<br /><b>A:</b> This product is cheap quality! I'll lose money.<br /><b>B:</b> I'll give it to you for $35.<br /><b>A:</b> Make it $30 and you've got a deal.<br /><b>B:</b> Alright, $30 sounds fine.
<b>A:</b> I really like your shoes.<br /><b>B:</b> Thank you!<br /><b>A:</b> Where did you buy them?<br /><b>B:</b> I bought them at a store in the mall.<br /><b>A:</b> Were they very expensive?<br /><b>B:</b> They were around $40.<br /><b>A:</b> They look very comfortable.<br /><b>B:</b> They are extremely comfortable.<br /><b>A:</b> Do they come in many other colors?<br /><b>B:</b> I saw several different ones when I bought them.<br /><b>A:</b> Maybe I'll buy myself a pair.<br /><b>B:</b> They are definitely worth the money.
<b>A:</b> I'm thinking of buying a bicycle.<br /><b>B:</b> That sounds like a good idea.<br /><b>A:</b> Yes, it would help me beat the car traffic.<br /><b>B:</b> It would also save you a lot of gas money.<br /><b>A:</b> I'm kind of scared though.<br /><b>B:</b> Scared of what?<br /><b>A:</b> I don't want to fall.<br /><b>B:</b> As long as you practice you should be fine.<br /><b>A:</b> Yes, but I could also get hit by a car.<br /><b>B:</b> I think you will be okay. Just make sure to buy a helmet, too.
<b>A:</b> I want to buy my son a skateboard.<br /><b>B:</b> Do you know what kind of board he'd like?<br /><b>A:</b> I was thinking a basic board.<br /><b>B:</b> There are many different kinds.<br /><b>A:</b> Is there one that is safer than the others?<br /><b>B:</b> Not really. You should buy safety equipment.<br /><b>A:</b> What should I buy?<br /><b>B:</b> A helmet, some elbow pads, and some knee pads.<br /><b>A:</b> Can I also have some wrist guards?<br /><b>B:</b> Certainly, you may choose any color you'd like.<br /><b>A:</b> I came for a skateboard and left with the whole store.<br /><b>B:</b> Well, safety always comes first!
<b>A:</b> My house is much too stuffy nowadays.<br /><b>B:</b> It's the hot weather.<br /><b>A:</b> I bought an air conditioner, but it doesn't help at night.<br /><b>B:</b> I heard it's bad to leave it on at night.<br /><b>A:</b> Why can't I leave it on at night?<br /><b>B:</b> It causes you to catch cold.<br /><b>A:</b> I bought a fan, but it makes too much noise.<br /><b>B:</b> Why don't you install a ceiling fan?<br /><b>A:</b> Are they quiet?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, and inexpensive, too.<br /><b>A:</b> Is it easy to install?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes. If they weren't, they'd fall on people all the time.
<b>A:</b> Let's plan a vacation.<br /><b>B:</b> Yes! I want to go somewhere warm.<br /><b>A:</b> I was thinking of going somewhere cold and fresh.<br /><b>B:</b> But I want to spend time on beaches.<br /><b>A:</b> We always go to beaches.<br /><b>B:</b> That's because they are always fun.<br /><b>A:</b> Let's try something different.<br /><b>B:</b> Where do you want to go?<br /><b>A:</b> We could visit Alaska.<br /><b>B:</b> But I don't even like the cold.<br /><b>A:</b> Come on. The views look beautiful.<br /><b>B:</b> Fine. But I get to plan our vacation next time.
<b>A:</b> Did you feel the earthquake last night?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, the whole house was shaking!<br /><b>A:</b> I was afraid the windows would shatter!<br /><b>B:</b> A lot of my collectibles fell off their shelves.<br /><b>A:</b> Did they break?<br /><b>B:</b> Unfortunately. Some of them can be fixed, though.<br /><b>A:</b> My cat was outside when the earthquake started.<br /><b>B:</b> Oh no! That's terrible! Is she ok?<br /><b>A:</b> She's fine. Animals have good natural instincts.<br /><b>B:</b> I wish people could predict earthquakes, too.<br /><b>A:</b> I think it would just make people panic more easily.<br /><b>B:</b> You're right. Maybe it's best to leave it to cats.
<b>A:</b> It's been very sunny lately, hasn't it?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, it has. Some rain would be very nice.<br /><b>A:</b> I don't think it will rain for quite some time.<br /><b>B:</b> Maybe we can do a rain dance and summon rain.<br /><b>A:</b> Do you really believe in that?<br /><b>B:</b> No, but who knows, maybe it does work.<br /><b>A:</b> I don't see how dancing around would bring rain.<br /><b>B:</b> Well, it would be pretty funny-looking.<br /><b>A:</b> The rain gods would laugh at us.<br /><b>B:</b> Maybe they'll laugh so hard they'll cry.<br /><b>A:</b> I don't think I want tears as rain!<br /><b>B:</b> Me neither. I suddenly don't mind the sunny weather.
<b>A:</b> This is the hottest summer ever.<br /><b>B:</b> I bet you could fry an egg on the sidewalk!<br /><b>A:</b> There has to be some way to cool off!<br /><b>B:</b> Let's go to the mall. It's air conditioned.<br /><b>A:</b> I bet the whole city will be there.<br /><b>B:</b> Then let's watch TV at your house.<br /><b>A:</b> That sounds boring. There's nothing good on TV.<br /><b>B:</b> What do you want to do, then?<br /><b>A:</b> Let's go to the pool to swim.<br /><b>B:</b> I think I'll pass.<br /><b>A:</b> Why don't you want to go?<br /><b>B:</b> If the sidewalk can fry an egg, the water will boil us.
<b>A:</b> Can I have your phone number?<br /><b>B:</b> What do you want it for?<br /><b>A:</b> I got a new phone and all my contacts were deleted.<br /><b>B:</b> You never called me, anyway.<br /><b>A:</b> What if there's an emergency?<br /><b>B:</b> You won't need me in an emergency.<br /><b>A:</b> Why don't you want to give me your number?<br /><b>B:</b> I don't like giving my phone number to people.<br /><b>A:</b> Alright, can I have your email address?<br /><b>B:</b> Quit trying to stalk me!<br /><b>A:</b> I was only trying to be friendly!<br /><b>B:</b> Well, stop trying. You're not getting my email, either.
<b>A:</b> Have you ever flown on an airplane?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, I've flown in planes many times.<br /><b>A:</b> Were you scared?<br /><b>B:</b> The first time I was a little bit scared.<br /><b>A:</b> But it went away after that?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes. After the first take-off, it was very simple and enjoyable.<br /><b>A:</b> I've never gotten on a plane before.<br /><b>B:</b> You have never flown in planes?<br /><b>A:</b> Nope. I'm going to fly for the first time tomorrow.<br /><b>B:</b> You'll love it! Don't you have first-class tickets?<br /><b>A:</b> No, they're coach tickets.<br /><b>B:</b> Just take earplugs in case there are babies on board.
<b>A:</b> Are you wearing those shoes with your suit?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes. Is there something wrong with that?<br /><b>A:</b> Well, they are very dirty and scuffed up.<br /><b>B:</b> They're the only shoes I have.<br /><b>A:</b> Your shoes are fine, but you should shine them.<br /><b>B:</b> Do I have to?<br /><b>A:</b> It would make a good impression.<br /><b>B:</b> How does being shiny make a good impression?<br /><b>A:</b> Your employer will think you're very neat.<br /><b>B:</b> Is that important?<br /><b>A:</b> A neat person is more likely to be hired.<br /><b>B:</b> Unless they're late for work from shining their shoes.
<b>A:</b> Do you have a chainsaw?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, but why do you need it?<br /><b>A:</b> I want to cut down the tree in my yard.<br /><b>B:</b> What's wrong with it? It's a beautiful tree.<br /><b>A:</b> It drops too many leaves.<br /><b>B:</b> There are squirrels in that tree.<br /><b>A:</b> The roots messed up my water system.<br /><b>B:</b> The neighborhood children love climbing it.<br /><b>A:</b> Birds land on it and poop on my car.<br /><b>B:</b> People love the romantic and cooling shade it gives.<br /><b>A:</b> I suppose the tree does have some good points.<br /><b>B:</b> If you see the good, the bad won't seem so bad.
<b>A:</b> My computer won't turn on.<br /><b>B:</b> Did you charge the battery?<br /><b>A:</b> Yes, I charged it all night.<br /><b>B:</b> Have you dropped it recently?<br /><b>A:</b> No, I've never dropped it.<br /><b>B:</b> Maybe it has a virus.<br /><b>A:</b> You mean maybe it's sick?<br /><b>B:</b> No, you may have downloaded spyware.<br /><b>A:</b> Do you think I need a new computer?<br /><b>B:</b> Probably, and some spyware protection, too.<br /><b>A:</b> I bet it was the government spying on me!<br /><b>B:</b> I really doubt you're worth spying on.
<b>A:</b> You didn't answer your phone last night.<br /><b>B:</b> The phone company cut my wireless.<br /><b>A:</b> Why? Did you pay your phone bills?<br /><b>B:</b> I refused to pay the last one.<br /><b>A:</b> Why didn't you want to pay it?<br /><b>B:</b> It was much too high!<br /><b>A:</b> Did you make many long-distance calls?<br /><b>B:</b> I thought it was free to call others' cell phones.<br /><b>A:</b> Only if they're from the same provider.<br /><b>B:</b> Oops. Then it was my fault.<br /><b>A:</b> You'd better call the company and apologize for this mess.<br /><b>B:</b> Can I use your phone? Mine is still dead.
<b>A:</b> Did you hear about the community college?<br /><b>B:</b> No. What about it?<br /><b>A:</b> It's offering summer courses.<br /><b>B:</b> I'm too old to go back to school.<br /><b>A:</b> Those kinds of courses are not the ones I'm talking about.<br /><b>B:</b> What are you so excited for, then?<br /><b>A:</b> They're offering music lessons!<br /><b>B:</b> That sounds interesting. What kind?<br /><b>A:</b> They teach almost every instrument there is!<br /><b>B:</b> Wow! I've always wanted to play the guitar.<br /><b>A:</b> Do you really think you can with such fat fingers?
<b>A:</b> David did not come to work again today.<br /><b>B:</b> He must be very sick to be absent a whole week.<br /><b>A:</b> My sister made him some soup yesterday.<br /><b>B:</b> Soup is very good for sick people to eat.<br /><b>A:</b> Apparently, it wasn't good enough.<br /><b>B:</b> What else does one do for a sick person?<br /><b>A:</b> I'm going to send him a get-well card.<br /><b>B:</b> That is very nice of you.<br /><b>A:</b> Maybe I'll get the whole office to sign it.<br /><b>B:</b> Good idea, but I suggest you mail it to him.<br /><b>A:</b> Why can't I take it to him?<br /><b>B:</b> If you catch his cold, it will mean more work for us!
<b>A:</b> Do you have any pets?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes. I have two fishes.<br /><b>A:</b> That's it? Why don't you get more pets?<br /><b>B:</b> I'm allergic to fur.<br /><b>A:</b> That's terrible. I love cats and dogs.<br /><b>B:</b> Do you own any?<br /><b>A:</b> I have two cats and three dogs.<br /><b>B:</b> Wow, that's a lot of animals.<br /><b>A:</b> I know, but I love them so much.<br /><b>B:</b> I wish I could own a cat someday.<br /><b>A:</b> You're not happy with your fishes?<br /><b>B:</b> Not really. I can't even pet them.<br /><b>A:</b> Maybe you could get a snake.<br /><b>B:</b> I'm not that desperate.
<b>A:</b> Did you watch that show on TV last night?<br /><b>B:</b> Do you mean the one about the zombies?<br /><b>A:</b> Yes! Isn't it a great show?<br /><b>B:</b> I didn't watch the whole episode.<br /><b>A:</b> Why not? Didn't you like it?<br /><b>B:</b> I did, but my son didn't.<br /><b>A:</b> He is too young to be watching that show!<br /><b>B:</b> I know. I didn't mean to let him watch it.<br /><b>A:</b> How did he see it, then?<br /><b>B:</b> He snuck into the living-room after his bedtime.<br /><b>A:</b> Children are so crafty in getting what they want.<br /><b>B:</b> Tell me about it. My son is like James Bond!
<b>A:</b> Why are you wearing a face mask?<br /><b>B:</b> I don't want to catch anything.<br /><b>A:</b> You won't get sick from breathing fresh air.<br /><b>B:</b> There are germs floating everywhere!<br /><b>A:</b> It is still unlikely that you will get sick.<br /><b>B:</b> Why do you say that?<br /><b>A:</b> Most of the time, we get sick from germs on our hands.<br /><b>B:</b> You're kidding, right?<br /><b>A:</b> No, we touch a lot of dirty things every day.<br /><b>B:</b> I need some hand sanitizer!<br /><b>A:</b> I didn't mean for you to become paranoid!<br /><b>B:</b> I'm not paranoid! I just want to be healthy.
<b>A:</b> Can I borrow your class notes?<br /><b>B:</b> Sure, but didn't you take any down?<br /><b>A:</b> I couldn't really see the board.<br /><b>B:</b> Do you sit too far away?<br /><b>A:</b> I think I just need new glasses.<br /><b>B:</b> You should be careful. It could be serious.<br /><b>A:</b> What do you mean?<br /><b>B:</b> You could have a concussion.<br /><b>A:</b> Or worms could be eating my eyes.<br /><b>B:</b> Maybe you're a robot and your batteries are dying!<br /><b>A:</b> I'm pretty sure I just need new glasses.<br /><b>B:</b> Even so, you should probably buy some batteries.
<b>A:</b> Hey, where were you all afternoon?<br /><b>B:</b> I was working out at the health club!<br /><b>A:</b> You went to the gym?<br /><b>B:</b> It's more than just a gym.<br /><b>A:</b> All you do is lift weights, right?<br /><b>B:</b> No, there's also swimming, sports, and even dancing!<br /><b>A:</b> They have dancing at the health club?<br /><b>B:</b> Of course! It's good for your coordination.<br /><b>A:</b> I've heard that it's also good for toning your muscles.<br /><b>B:</b> You should join me sometime!<br /><b>A:</b> Maybe if I work out, I'll look like Arnold Schwarzenneger!<br /><b>B:</b> I think you look more like Danny Devito.
<b>A:</b> How many cups of coffee have you had today?!<br /><b>B:</b> I don't know, three, maybe?<br /><b>A:</b> Don't you think that's a little too much?<br /><b>B:</b> No way! Coffee is good for you.<br /><b>A:</b> Too much of anything is bad for you!<br /><b>B:</b> What about water?<br /><b>A:</b> Sure! People drown all the time.<br /><b>B:</b> Well, I'd happily drown in coffee.<br /><b>A:</b> Did you know coffee stains your teeth brown?<br /><b>B:</b> Does it, really?!<br /><b>A:</b> Yes. Your teeth will rot out if you drink too much.<br /><b>B:</b> I'd better stop, then; girls like nice, white smiles!
<b>A:</b> It's so hot! Let's go swimming now!<br /><b>B:</b> We have to wait a while before swimming.<br /><b>A:</b> But why? The sun is so hot!<br /><b>B:</b> It's bad to swim after you just ate.<br /><b>A:</b> Why? Will you sink in the water?<br /><b>B:</b> No. The motion and sudden cold will make you sick.<br /><b>A:</b> What kind of sick?<br /><b>B:</b> It can make you nauseated, and you might throw up.<br /><b>A:</b> How long do we have to wait?<br /><b>B:</b> Only about half an hour.<br /><b>A:</b> Half an hour?! I'll bake in the sun!<br /><b>B:</b> It's better than throwing up your lunch!
<b>A:</b> Can you help me get up the stairs, please?<br /><b>B:</b> Of course. What happened to your leg?<br /><b>A:</b> I broke it a week ago.<br /><b>B:</b> How did that happen?<br /><b>A:</b> I was playing basketball and fell.<br /><b>B:</b> Ouch! Did someone push you?<br /><b>A:</b> No, I just jumped and landed wrong.<br /><b>B:</b> I broke my leg once too.<br /><b>A:</b> How did it happen to you?<br /><b>B:</b> A boy pushed me down a hill and I landed on my leg.<br /><b>A:</b> That sounds like a mean kid.<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, but I kicked him with the cast.
<b>A:</b> Ow! That really hurts!<br /><b>B:</b> Are you alright? What happened?<br /><b>A:</b> I accidentally cut myself.<br /><b>B:</b> Is it very deep?<br /><b>A:</b> I don't think so, but it hurts a lot.<br /><b>B:</b> You should disinfect it.<br /><b>A:</b> I don't have anything with me.<br /><b>B:</b> Here, use this ointment.<br /><b>A:</b> Do you always carry that with you?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, along with some bandages.<br /><b>A:</b> That's a very good idea.<br /><b>B:</b> Perhaps you should do the same.
<b>A:</b> How are you feeling?<br /><b>B:</b> A little better, but it is still hard to talk.<br /><b>A:</b> What did the doctor say the problem was?<br /><b>B:</b> It's called mononucleosis.<br /><b>A:</b> Isn't that the kissing disease?<br /><b>B:</b> There are ways to get it besides kissing!<br /><b>A:</b> Oh yeah? Name a few.<br /><b>B:</b> Sharing drinks and food also spreads the disease.<br /><b>A:</b> Really?! I share drinks with my friends all the time!<br /><b>B:</b> Yeah, so did I.<br /><b>A:</b> Well, I won't share with you again, that's for sure!<br /><b>B:</b> I won't share with anyone ever again!
<b>A:</b> Ah!! I've got a cramp in my foot!<br /><b>B:</b> Stop swimming and roll onto your back!<br /><b>A:</b> It really hurts!<br /><b>B:</b> It will stop hurting if you rest a while.<br /><b>A:</b> Why did you tell me to roll on my back?<br /><b>B:</b> It's easier if you just float until the pain stops.<br /><b>A:</b> It hurts even if I don't move my foot!<br /><b>B:</b> At least your face is not in the water.<br /><b>A:</b> I think the cramp went away.<br /><b>B:</b> Can you move your foot now?<br /><b>A:</b> Yes; thanks for your quick thinking.<br /><b>B:</b> No problem. Let's get to the shallow water.
<b>A:</b> Your son is so healthy!<br /><b>B:</b> He is already very concerned with fitness.<br /><b>A:</b> That is so wonderful!<br /><b>B:</b> He likes to eat healthy and exercise every day.<br /><b>A:</b> My son likes chocolate and video games.<br /><b>B:</b> That is not good for him at all!<br /><b>A:</b> I don't know what to do with him.<br /><b>B:</b> Make him some fun snacks for school.<br /><b>A:</b> I gave him carrot sticks once.<br /><b>B:</b> That's a good snack!<br /><b>A:</b> Later he admitted that he gave them to the school rabbit.<br /><b>B:</b> Well, at least the rabbit eats its vegetables.
<b>A:</b> 911! What is your emergency?<br /><b>B:</b> Hello, this is John. My child swallowed something.<br /><b>A:</b> Is your child breathing alright?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, but he is complaining of chest pains.<br /><b>A:</b> Do you know what it is he swallowed?<br /><b>B:</b> It was a coin. I think it was a nickel.<br /><b>A:</b> How old is your son?<br /><b>B:</b> He's five years old.<br /><b>A:</b> Please give me your address, and we will send paramedics.<br /><b>B:</b> Should I hang up after that?<br /><b>A:</b> No, please stay on the line in case something changes.<br /><b>B:</b> Alright, thank you.
<b>A:</b> You look troubled.<br /><b>B:</b> I feel terrible.<br /><b>A:</b> What's the problem?<br /><b>B:</b> I went hiking in the mountains last week.<br /><b>A:</b> Isn't that supposed to relax you?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, but I wore shorts instead of pants.<br /><b>A:</b> So? It's hot there.<br /><b>B:</b> I was eaten alive by mosquitoes and ticks.<br /><b>A:</b> Deer ticks are really dangerous!<br /><b>B:</b> I know! I had to go to the doctor.<br /><b>A:</b> Be more mindful next time.<br /><b>B:</b> Trust me, I will. I hate deer ticks.
<b>A:</b> I'm so tired today.<br /><b>B:</b> Did you stay up late watching TV again?<br /><b>A:</b> No, I tried to sleep at 11 p.m.!<br /><b>B:</b> And you couldn't fall asleep?<br /><b>A:</b> No. I lay in bed until 3 a.m.<br /><b>B:</b> Isn't that the time you usually fall asleep?<br /><b>A:</b> I suppose it is, actually.<br /><b>B:</b> Your body is too used to going to sleep really late.<br /><b>A:</b> What should I do? I'm tired.<br /><b>B:</b> Try to tire yourself out and sleep early today.<br /><b>A:</b> Tonight is the season finale, though…<br /><b>B:</b> You're hopeless!
<b>A:</b> My hair isn't soft and shiny anymore.<br /><b>B:</b> Maybe you should do a hair treatment.<br /><b>A:</b> Hair products are expensive, though!<br /><b>B:</b> You can use certain foods to do it, too.<br /><b>A:</b> Really? Which ones?<br /><b>B:</b> I heard that avocado is really good for your hair.<br /><b>A:</b> Oh, gross! I don't want to smell like mayonnaise!<br /><b>B:</b> Well, other people use avocado.<br /><b>A:</b> Great. I could either be a sandwich or a salad.<br /><b>B:</b> You could always use baby oil and shampoo.<br /><b>A:</b> Now that sounds more pleasant!<br /><b>B:</b> If you say so. I don't mind using avocado.
<b>A:</b> Why are you using crutches?<br /><b>B:</b> Can you keep a secret?<br /><b>A:</b> Of course I can! What happened?<br /><b>B:</b> I sprained my ankle yesterday.<br /><b>A:</b> What were you doing?<br /><b>B:</b> It's kind of a secret.<br /><b>A:</b> Why is it a secret?<br /><b>B:</b> I'm a spy, and if I tell you, I'll get in trouble.<br /><b>A:</b> Do you really expect me to believe that?!<br /><b>B:</b> Alright, I'll be serious this time.<br /><b>A:</b> Good. What really happened?<br /><b>B:</b> I got hurt during my ninja training.
<b>A:</b> Public restrooms gross me out.<br /><b>B:</b> They're not always bad.<br /><b>A:</b> Even when they look clean, there are germs everywhere.<br /><b>B:</b> That's because so many people don't wash their hands.<br /><b>A:</b> That makes me so angry.<br /><b>B:</b> Me too. Washing hands is a simple thing to do.<br /><b>A:</b> I think everyone is just too lazy to do it.<br /><b>B:</b> It's very rude of them.<br /><b>A:</b> I agree. Even five-year-olds know better than not to wash their hands.<br /><b>B:</b> But there's not much we can do about it.
<b>A:</b> I think I'm going to head home.<br /><b>B:</b> Already? It's only midday!<br /><b>A:</b> I think I have a fever.<br /><b>B:</b> That's terrible! Does your head hurt?<br /><b>A:</b> Yes, it's killing me!<br /><b>B:</b> You should go home if you're not feeling well.<br /><b>A:</b> I'm going to tell the boss that I'm leaving early.<br /><b>B:</b> I'm sure he will understand.<br /><b>A:</b> On the way home, I'll pick up some soup.<br /><b>B:</b> Make sure to drink lots of fluids!<br /><b>A:</b> I will. Thank you.<br /><b>B:</b> I hope you feel better soon.
<b>A:</b> Why are you limping around like that?<br /><b>B:</b> I signed up for the new yoga class.<br /><b>A:</b> Did they make you do all those weird positions?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes! Some of those stretches hurt!<br /><b>A:</b> I'm not flexible enough for yoga.<br /><b>B:</b> I don't think I am, either.<br /><b>A:</b> Why did you sign up for it?<br /><b>B:</b> I heard it's good for your body.<br /><b>A:</b> I heard mostly women take that class.<br /><b>B:</b> Well, there's that, too.<br /><b>A:</b> This is punishment for your bad intentions.<br /><b>B:</b> Maybe. Either way, I don't deserve this!
<b>A:</b> I think David is running a fever.<br /><b>B:</b> What should we do? His parents are not here.<br /><b>A:</b> I don't want to give him anything he shouldn't take.<br /><b>B:</b> How do we know what dose is right for him?<br /><b>A:</b> We should call the local pharmacy!<br /><b>B:</b> Can they help us? They're not doctors.<br /><b>A:</b> I'm sure they can.<br /><b>B:</b> It's worth a try; what's the number?<br /><b>A:</b> It's here, on this receipt.<br /><b>B:</b> Thank you. Can you call his parents?<br /><b>A:</b> What should I say?<br /><b>B:</b> We need to let them know he is feeling sick.
<b>A:</b> You lost a lot of weight!<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, thank you for noticing.<br /><b>A:</b> You look great. How did you do it?<br /><b>B:</b> I started eating a lot healthier.<br /><b>A:</b> That's too hard for me to do.<br /><b>B:</b> I also exercise four times a week.<br /><b>A:</b> Oh, I don't have time for that.<br /><b>B:</b> It can be hard to find time. However, it is worth it.<br /><b>A:</b> I'm thinking of just trying some new diet pills.<br /><b>B:</b> I suggest you try doing it naturally. I can help you if you want.<br /><b>A:</b> That'd be great!
<b>A:</b> Hey, what's that you're eating?<br /><b>B:</b> It's steamed rice cake. My grandma made it.<br /><b>A:</b> Does it taste good?<br /><b>B:</b> It's delicious! I think it's my favorite dessert.<br /><b>A:</b> I think I'll stick to jelly doughnuts. Do you want one?<br /><b>B:</b> No thanks. If you eat too many of those, you'll get fat!<br /><b>A:</b> All pastries make you fat.<br /><b>B:</b> That's true, but the ones with sugar are the worst.<br /><b>A:</b> Sugar makes them taste good!<br /><b>B:</b> Try this rice cake. It has very little sugar.<br /><b>A:</b> I guess that is pretty good!<br /><b>B:</b> It is! And it's healthier than doughnuts, too!
<b>A:</b> Hello, 911? I need an ambulance.<br /><b>B:</b> What's the situation?<br /><b>A:</b> My friend fell off her bike and hit her head.<br /><b>B:</b> Is she unconscious?<br /><b>A:</b> No, but she is bleeding a lot.<br /><b>B:</b> Please tell me your location.<br /><b>A:</b> We are near the community college.<br /><b>B:</b> Please don't let her stand. Do you have her ID?<br /><b>A:</b> Yes. I also found her insurance card.<br /><b>B:</b> Good, you will need those at the hospital.<br /><b>A:</b> She is beginning to feel less dizzy.<br /><b>B:</b> Good, just sit tight, the ambulance will be there soon.
<b>A:</b> Do you know where I could get a back massage?<br /><b>B:</b> What's wrong with your back?<br /><b>A:</b> It hurts a lot when I sit for too long.<br /><b>B:</b> A masseuse will not help you with that pain.<br /><b>A:</b> What do you suggest I do?<br /><b>B:</b> I think you should go to the chiropractor.<br /><b>A:</b> What does he do?<br /><b>B:</b> He adjusts the alignment of your back.<br /><b>A:</b> Does that help with the pain?<br /><b>B:</b> It usually does.<br /><b>A:</b> Where can I find one?<br /><b>B:</b> Look one up online. I'm sure you'll find one near you.
<b>A:</b> I have so many split ends!<br /><b>B:</b> How do you brush your hair?<br /><b>A:</b> The same way everyone else does.<br /><b>B:</b> I don't think so! You're supposed to use a brush.<br /><b>A:</b> A comb isn't that different from a brush.<br /><b>B:</b> Combs tear long hair and cause split ends!<br /><b>A:</b> Really? All this time, I blamed my shampoo!<br /><b>B:</b> Well, good shampoo helps to repair it.<br /><b>A:</b> What should I do?<br /><b>B:</b> Always brush it before you comb it.<br /><b>A:</b> Then maybe I won't look like a broom!<br /><b>B:</b> It takes hard work to have nice hair!
<b>A:</b> That's a funny-looking outfit!<br /><b>B:</b> It's a professional running suit.<br /><b>A:</b> Why are you wearing it?<br /><b>B:</b> I'm training for the marathon!<br /><b>A:</b> I didn't know you liked running.<br /><b>B:</b> I'm just trying to lose weight.<br /><b>A:</b> Well, this is a good way to do it.<br /><b>B:</b> The marathon is also a fundraiser.<br /><b>A:</b> Maybe I'll sponsor you.<br /><b>B:</b> Why don't you just run instead?<br /><b>A:</b> Are you calling me fat?<br /><b>B:</b> I just thought both sides would benefit that way.
<b>A:</b> I can't believe Obama won before Hilary!<br /><b>B:</b> You can't believe an African American beat a woman?<br /><b>A:</b> You are being very stereotypical.<br /><b>B:</b> I'm just trying to prove a point.<br /><b>A:</b> What point would that be?<br /><b>B:</b> America is still racist and sexist.<br /><b>A:</b> It does seem like the election was eventually based on those aspects.<br /><b>B:</b> Why did you want Hilary to win?<br /><b>A:</b> I have always liked her political standing.<br /><b>B:</b> I think they'd both make good presidents.<br /><b>A:</b> I guess we'll see how Obama does.<br /><b>B:</b> I just hope stereotypes aren't so pronounced now, too.
<b>A:</b> Have you voted for the class representative?<br /><b>B:</b> No, I'm not sure who to choose!<br /><b>A:</b> The first candidate says he will save the school money.<br /><b>B:</b> The second says he will arrange more school trips.<br /><b>A:</b> It sounds like one saves and one spends.<br /><b>B:</b> They both have similar policies on tardiness.<br /><b>A:</b> They also talk about caring for the student body.<br /><b>B:</b> I heard that the first candidate got detention once, though.<br /><b>A:</b> What did he get the detention for?<br /><b>B:</b> He didn't turn in his assignments.<br /><b>A:</b> I don't want such a careless representative.<br /><b>B:</b> Me neither.
<b>A:</b> Have you gone to vote today?<br /><b>B:</b> I didn't even know there was an election.<br /><b>A:</b> Didn't you get the pamphlet?<br /><b>B:</b> I must have forgotten about it.<br /><b>A:</b> Here, you can read mine.<br /><b>B:</b> Why is it so important to vote, anyway?<br /><b>A:</b> It's the only way to make our voices heard.<br /><b>B:</b> Our opinions won't make much of a difference.<br /><b>A:</b> The most popular opinion will.<br /><b>B:</b> I guess if I vote, my opinion will be a little more popular.<br /><b>A:</b> That's the spirit!<br /><b>B:</b> Let's go vote now, before the lines get too long.
<b>A:</b> My university is passing out fliers for health insurance.<br /><b>B:</b> Mine, too. If I don't choose, I'll get Obamacare.<br /><b>A:</b> What's Obamacare?<br /><b>B:</b> It's the new healthcare provided by the Affordable Healthcare Act.<br /><b>A:</b> What does it promise?<br /><b>B:</b> It just regulates health insurance so that it's affordable for everyone.<br /><b>A:</b> That sounds like a great step forward!<br /><b>B:</b> I think Obama is really keeping his promises.<br /><b>A:</b> I wish there were more changes to the education system.<br /><b>B:</b> Most of the acts passed were to help immigrant students.<br /><b>A:</b> It's a shame they fight so hard for underfunded education.<br /><b>B:</b> It's a bit of a letdown for everybody.
<b>A:</b> They should increase the voting age to 21.<br /><b>B:</b> Why do you think they should do that?<br /><b>A:</b> Well, people can't drink until they're 21.<br /><b>B:</b> That's so they'll have time to make the right decision.<br /><b>A:</b> They can't decide what's best for them until they're 21.<br /><b>B:</b> I suppose you have a point.<br /><b>A:</b> Voting is something very important.<br /><b>B:</b> People should think hard and make the right decision.<br /><b>A:</b> I hope the teenagers are old enough to do that.<br /><b>B:</b> Maybe your idea is a good one.<br /><b>A:</b> Then again, lots of adults don't vote, either.<br /><b>B:</b> I guess it always depends on the individual.
<b>A:</b> I hate proxy voting.<br /><b>B:</b> What's proxy voting?<br /><b>A:</b> It's when a vote can be made for you by a committee.<br /><b>B:</b> That sounds unfair!<br /><b>A:</b> I think if someone is unable to vote, no one should vote for them.<br /><b>B:</b> Is this done for civilians?<br /><b>A:</b> No, usually for members of a committee.<br /><b>B:</b> I still think it's unfair.<br /><b>A:</b> Me, too.<br /><b>B:</b> The rule should not exist.<br /><b>A:</b> Soon, they'll be applying it to us, too!<br /><b>B:</b> I hope that never happens.
<b>A:</b> Are you a Democrat or a Republican?<br /><b>B:</b> I am a Republican, of course.<br /><b>A:</b> Republicans are conceited and judgmental!<br /><b>B:</b> Your liberal stubbornness tells me you're a Democrat.<br /><b>A:</b> Don't insult me!<br /><b>B:</b> There's a reason the Democrats' mascot is a donkey.<br /><b>A:</b> At least we're not unforgiving elephants!<br /><b>B:</b> I don't agree with any of the Democratic outlooks.<br /><b>A:</b> I don't believe in any Republican beliefs, either.<br /><b>B:</b> What should we do, then?<br /><b>A:</b> Let's just not talk politics, or we'll be like those terrible politicians!<br /><b>B:</b> I guess regardless of viewpoints, politicians are all bad.
<b>A:</b> They're really trying hard to get teenagers to vote!<br /><b>B:</b> I love the commercials on television about it!<br /><b>A:</b> You mean the ones with the famous TV stars?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, and the singers, too!<br /><b>A:</b> They're all done by the Rock the Vote organization.<br /><b>B:</b> It's a really good marketing idea.<br /><b>A:</b> It makes me want to vote!<br /><b>B:</b> And it's good to show how important voting really is.<br /><b>A:</b> They should make those commercials for policies, too.<br /><b>B:</b> They'd be better than those misleading commercials.<br /><b>A:</b> I agree. It seems like all those commercials tell lies.<br /><b>B:</b> Maybe I'll volunteer with Rock the Vote someday!
<b>A:</b> Did you hear about the ID enforcement?<br /><b>B:</b> No, what's that?<br /><b>A:</b> It's a law requiring voters to show ID before voting.<br /><b>B:</b> That doesn't sound like a bad idea.<br /><b>A:</b> There are many voters who cannot afford an ID, though.<br /><b>B:</b> I didn't think about that.<br /><b>A:</b> If IDs are required, even less people will show up to vote.<br /><b>B:</b> That completely goes against what they're trying to accomplish.<br /><b>A:</b> Besides, many voters don't even have a birth certificate.<br /><b>B:</b> That's another big problem.<br /><b>A:</b> I'm completely against this voting requirement.<br /><b>B:</b> Me, too! All it will do is keep people from voting.
<b>A:</b> My household is registered as Republican.<br /><b>B:</b> Why is that so upsetting?<br /><b>A:</b> I really want to vote for Obama!<br /><b>B:</b> You're allowed to vote for him even if you're Republican.<br /><b>A:</b> Really? I didn't know that.<br /><b>B:</b> Of course, you're not restricted from anything.<br /><b>A:</b> Can I also vote for Republican State representatives?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, that's okay, too.<br /><b>A:</b> I prefer a world not based on what party you're in.<br /><b>B:</b> Me, too. It makes things seem a lot more equal.<br /><b>A:</b> I'm going to fill out my sample ballot now!<br /><b>B:</b> Alright! I will, too.
<b>A:</b> The girls at school don't want to be my friends.<br /><b>B:</b> Why don't they want to be your friends?<br /><b>A:</b> It's because I don't dress like they do.<br /><b>B:</b> There is nothing wrong with the way you dress.<br /><b>A:</b> They listen to different music.<br /><b>B:</b> Music is pointless if you don't enjoy it.<br /><b>A:</b> They curl their hair and eyelashes.<br /><b>B:</b> Doing that everyday damages your hair.<br /><b>A:</b> Maybe if I do those things, I can be their friend.<br /><b>B:</b> It won't be fun to do things you don't enjoy.<br /><b>A:</b> Then who will be my friend?<br /><b>B:</b> I'm your friend, because I like you for who you are.
<b>A:</b> We have to babysit this afternoon.<br /><b>B:</b> Why can't we ever go out with mom and dad?<br /><b>A:</b> They say they need time away from children.<br /><b>B:</b> We're not children anymore!<br /><b>A:</b> I guess that's why we have to watch the baby.<br /><b>B:</b> What do you want to do first?<br /><b>A:</b> We can play some video games.<br /><b>B:</b> Do you want to have ice cream for dinner?<br /><b>A:</b> That sounds good to me!<br /><b>B:</b> Oops! I spilled chocolate on the carpet.<br /><b>A:</b> We'll say the baby did it.<br /><b>B:</b> Maybe babysitting isn't so bad.
<b>A:</b> You never called me back last night.<br /><b>B:</b> I'm sorry; my grandma took away my phone.<br /><b>A:</b> What did she do that for?<br /><b>B:</b> She said it was too late to be talking on the phone.<br /><b>A:</b> You said you'd call me at 9 p.m.<br /><b>B:</b> That's the time she sent me to bed.<br /><b>A:</b> How can anyone sleep so early?<br /><b>B:</b> She said that was her usual bed time.<br /><b>A:</b> I guess old people need to sleep longer.<br /><b>B:</b> Not really. She woke me up at 5 a.m. this morning.<br /><b>A:</b> Wow! Your grandma really loves sunlight.<br /><b>B:</b> I'm so exhausted.
<b>A:</b> How do I get that boy to like me?<br /><b>B:</b> Just be yourself, and act naturally around him.<br /><b>A:</b> I already do that, and I still don't have a boyfriend.<br /><b>B:</b> You will, once the right boy comes along.<br /><b>A:</b> How do I know which boy is the right one?<br /><b>B:</b> You'll know because you'll fall in love.<br /><b>A:</b> How do I know if I'm in love or not?<br /><b>B:</b> All the love songs will make sense.<br /><b>A:</b> The only ones that make sense now are the sad ones.<br /><b>B:</b> Don't worry. Just be patient, and then you'll see.<br /><b>A:</b> You really think so?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes. Good things come to those who wait.
<b>A:</b> Computers are so amazing.<br /><b>B:</b> I agree! I love the new webcams.<br /><b>A:</b> Did you buy one recently?<br /><b>B:</b> My laptop came with one. My mother loves it.<br /><b>A:</b> Who does your mother use it to speak with?<br /><b>B:</b> She calls my great aunt from out of state.<br /><b>A:</b> I didn't know you had a great aunt.<br /><b>B:</b> Neither did I!<br /><b>A:</b> That webcam is bringing your family together.<br /><b>B:</b> It really is. I cannot wait to meet her!<br /><b>A:</b> I thought you already talk to her often.<br /><b>B:</b> I do, but I will meet her in person next month.
<b>A:</b> I don't know what to give my dad for Father's Day.<br /><b>B:</b> Why don't you give him a card?<br /><b>A:</b> I already bought a card, but I want to give him a present, too.<br /><b>B:</b> What does your father like to do?<br /><b>A:</b> He likes to cook.<br /><b>B:</b> Maybe you can give him a chef's hat.<br /><b>A:</b> Be serious! That gift is not practical.<br /><b>B:</b> What other sorts of things does he like?<br /><b>A:</b> He likes carpentry.<br /><b>B:</b> What about getting him a new carving set?<br /><b>A:</b> That sounds like a good idea.<br /><b>B:</b> Let's look for one online.
<b>A:</b> Why did you throw snow at your brother?<br /><b>B:</b> It was a snowball fight.<br /><b>A:</b> He said that he didn't know you were playing.<br /><b>B:</b> Well, he should've known once he felt the snowball.<br /><b>A:</b> Does this have anything to do with the snowman?<br /><b>B:</b> You mean the one he knocked down?<br /><b>A:</b> That's exactly the one I mean.<br /><b>B:</b> Maybe, but I just wanted to have a snowball fight.<br /><b>A:</b> You should be nicer to your brother.<br /><b>B:</b> He should be nicer to my snowmen.<br /><b>A:</b> Go say you're sorry and play nicely.<br /><b>B:</b> Only if he says he's sorry, first.

My hands did not go near the frosting.<br /><b>A:</b> Then how did you eat it?<br /><b>B:</b> I used a spoon, so I didn't touch it. I didn't disobey you.<br /><b>A:</b> You knew what I meant. No dessert for you tonight.<br /><b>B:</b> That's alright. I've already had some frosting.
<b>A:</b> I'm tired of living with my sister.<br /><b>B:</b> I don't like living with mine, either.<br /><b>A:</b> There should be a place to send annoying siblings.<br /><b>B:</b> What kind of place?<br /><b>A:</b> I don't know, maybe the zoo.<br /><b>B:</b> My sister is too wild to live in a zoo.<br /><b>A:</b> I think she'd scare all the animals.<br /><b>B:</b> Yeah, and eat all of their food.<br /><b>A:</b> What about the aquarium?<br /><b>B:</b> I guess the shark tank would be a good place.<br /><b>A:</b> It's too bad that humans can't breathe underwater.<br /><b>B:</b> What a shame, it was the perfect plan.
<b>A:</b> I told you not to go into my room!<br /><b>B:</b> I was just looking for a pencil.<br /><b>A:</b> You are always making up excuses.<br /><b>B:</b> My explanations are not excuses.<br /><b>A:</b> You just want to snoop around my room!<br /><b>B:</b> I don't want to be in your smelly room.<br /><b>A:</b> Then stop going into it!<br /><b>B:</b> Then help me find the things I need!<br /><b>A:</b> Fine.

They've known him since we were children.<br /><b>A:</b> He might as well be your brother.<br /><b>B:</b> I prefer having close friends to having a brother.<br /><b>A:</b> What's wrong with having a brother?<br /><b>B:</b> Brothers always fight over things they don't want to share.<br /><b>A:</b> Are you afraid he'd take your things?<br /><b>B:</b> No, I'm afraid he'd take my girlfriend.

We can make a sand castle.<br /><b>A:</b> Dad forgot the buckets at home.<br /><b>B:</b> We can explore the tide pools.<br /><b>A:</b> Maybe we'll find some crabs!<br /><b>B:</b> I think I'd like a seahorse better.<br /><b>A:</b> We can put them in our aquarium!<br /><b>B:</b> That's a great idea!<br /><b>A:</b> How will we carry them without buckets?<br /><b>B:</b> I forgot we don't have any.<br /><b>A:</b> What is there to do now?<br /><b>B:</b> Wait until it's time to go home.

<b>A:</b> Dad, why do you like fishing so much?<br /><b>B:</b> Fishing is a good way to clear your mind.<br /><b>A:</b> Is that because everything is so quiet?<br /><b>B:</b> That is exactly why.<br /><b>A:</b> Don't you get bored just sitting and waiting?<br /><b>B:</b> There is more to fishing than just sitting and waiting.<br /><b>A:</b> What do you mean?<br /><b>B:</b> To be a good fisherman, you have to read nature.<br /><b>A:</b> The same way you read a book?<br /><b>B:</b> Almost the same way. You'll learn in time.<br /><b>A:</b> Is that what you like most about fishing?<br /><b>B:</b> No. I like fishing together with you the most.
<b>A:</b> Excuse me, miss!<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, what can I do for you?<br /><b>A:</b> This bill is incorrect.<br /><b>B:</b> It is indeed correct.<br /><b>A:</b> I thought this plate of noodles was $10.<br /><b>B:</b> You misread it. It is $100, not $10.<br /><b>A:</b> Why is it so expensive?<br /><b>B:</b> There are rare ingredients in it.<br /><b>A:</b> What exactly are these "rare ingredients?"<br /><b>B:</b> Caviar, lobster, and a special type of mushroom.<br /><b>A:</b> I am not paying for this.<br /><b>B:</b> You already ate it, so you must pay for it.
<b>A:</b> That was a delicious dinner!<br /><b>B:</b> The waitress was bad though.<br /><b>A:</b> Don't be mean.<br /><b>B:</b> She dropped soup on my dress!<br /><b>A:</b> She did not drop it on purpose.<br /><b>B:</b> She also took forever to bring out the food.<br /><b>A:</b> Maybe she is a new employee.<br /><b>B:</b> I am not giving her a tip.<br /><b>A:</b> Oh, come on! At least give her a small one.<br /><b>B:</b> I am not even going to put a penny.<br /><b>A:</b> Fine, I'll put a tip.<br /><b>B:</b> You are way too nice.

I'll teach you.
<b>A:</b> Do you want to go to a buffet?<br /><b>B:</b> What is a buffet?<br /><b>A:</b> It's a restaurant where you can eat as much as you want.<br /><b>B:</b> That sounds awesome!<br /><b>A:</b> Yeah, it is.

<b>A:</b> Wow, I am the only one in this restaurant.<br /><b>B:</b> Well, it is 1:00 a.m.<br /><b>A:</b> Why doesn't this restaurant close earlier?<br /><b>B:</b> It's trying to make more money.<br /><b>A:</b> That's pretty smart.<br /><b>B:</b> Just curious, why are you here at this time?<br /><b>A:</b> I couldn't sleep.<br /><b>B:</b> Maybe you should see a doctor.<br /><b>A:</b> No, it's just a one-time thing.<br /><b>B:</b> I see. What would you like to order?<br /><b>A:</b> I'll have an egg and two bacon strips.<br /><b>B:</b> You'll have it very soon. There are no other customers here.

I don't like pancakes. I love them.
<b>A:</b> I am so hungry.<br /><b>B:</b> Me too. My stomach is growling.<br /><b>A:</b> Are there any good places nearby?<br /><b>B:</b> Do you want to go to the restaurant across the street?<br /><b>A:</b> Oh no! That place is so dirty!<br /><b>B:</b> I heard the food was good.<br /><b>A:</b> The food is good, but not the place itself.<br /><b>B:</b> What's so dirty about it?<br /><b>A:</b> The staff only cleans the tables once a day.<br /><b>B:</b> Wow, that is crazy! Anything else?<br /><b>A:</b> The bowls and plates are not washed well.<br /><b>B:</b> Let's not go there anymore.
<b>A:</b> Have you ever been to that popular hot dog stand?<br /><b>B:</b> No, I have not.<br /><b>A:</b> My friends said the hot dogs are really great.<br /><b>B:</b> The line is always really long.<br /><b>A:</b> I say we wait for them.<br /><b>B:</b> They're just hot dogs.<br /><b>A:</b> My friends said everyone should try it at least once.<br /><b>B:</b> Do you always listen to your friends?<br /><b>A:</b> No, but their opinions matter.<br /><b>B:</b> My opinion is: forget the hot dogs.<br /><b>A:</b> Fine, I'm going to eat one in front of you.<br /><b>B:</b> You won't ever reach the front of the line.
<b>A:</b> I am going to get the spaghetti.<br /><b>B:</b> I don't know what to get.<br /><b>A:</b> Just pick whatever looks good.<br /><b>B:</b> This is so hard.<br /><b>A:</b> Why don't you get the pizza?<br /><b>B:</b> It's too expensive.<br /><b>A:</b> How about the hamburger?<br /><b>B:</b> It's too fattening.<br /><b>A:</b> How about the burrito?<br /><b>B:</b> I hate Mexican food.<br /><b>A:</b> You are way too picky.<br /><b>B:</b> I'm just going to get water.
<b>A:</b> Hi sir, what can I get you today?<br /><b>B:</b> I'll have one glass of iced tea.<br /><b>A:</b> I'm sorry, but we are out of iced tea.<br /><b>B:</b> How can you be out of iced tea?<br /><b>A:</b> We didn't get all of the ingredients.<br /><b>B:</b> Iced tea is all I want.<br /><b>A:</b> Sir, we have plenty of other drinks.<br /><b>B:</b> I guess lemonade would be okay.<br /><b>A:</b> Lemonade coming right up!<br /><b>B:</b> Wait. You should give me a discount.<br /><b>A:</b> I will give you a 15% discount.<br /><b>B:</b> Good! This restaurant is doing something right today.

<b>A:</b> What did you think about the waiter?<br /><b>B:</b> He was nice.<br /><b>A:</b> We should give him a 40% tip.<br /><b>B:</b> That's too much.<br /><b>A:</b> You said he was nice!<br /><b>B:</b> He was nice, but he wasn't excellent.<br /><b>A:</b> Can we at least give him a 35% tip?<br /><b>B:</b> Why do you want to tip this guy so well?<br /><b>A:</b> He is my friend from school.<br /><b>B:</b> Oh, I see.<br /><b>A:</b> He's the only one who works in his family.<br /><b>B:</b> Fine, we will give him a good tip.
<b>A:</b> Would you like to try our new item for free?<br /><b>B:</b> If it's free, then of course.<br /><b>A:</b> Great! Here it is.<br /><b>B:</b> What is this?<br /><b>A:</b> It's a smoothie made from chicken and beef.<br /><b>B:</b> That is absolutely disgusting.<br /><b>A:</b> You didn't even try it yet.<br /><b>B:</b> I already know it's going to taste bad.<br /><b>A:</b> Please try it. You might love it.<br /><b>B:</b> I'll just have a slice of pizza.<br /><b>A:</b> I will get that for you.<br /><b>B:</b> Thanks, and take back the smoothie.
<b>A:</b> I am going to get the meatloaf.<br /><b>B:</b> Get anything but the meatloaf.<br /><b>A:</b> What's wrong with meatloaf?<br /><b>B:</b> I got food poisoning when I ordered meatloaf here.<br /><b>A:</b> Thanks for telling me.<br /><b>B:</b> No problem.

<b>A:</b> Have you been to this restaurant before?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes. The last time I came here was two years ago.<br /><b>A:</b> Does it still look the same?<br /><b>B:</b> It looks nicer now. The paintings are amazing.<br /><b>A:</b> Does the food taste the same?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes. Their crab cake tastes great as always.<br /><b>A:</b> I am allergic to crab.<br /><b>B:</b> That's too bad.<br /><b>A:</b> It's okay! The chicken sandwich is just as great.<br /><b>B:</b> I am allergic to chicken.<br /><b>A:</b> What aren't you allergic to?<br /><b>B:</b> All the stuff that tastes bad.
<b>A:</b> This chicken is so plain.<br /><b>B:</b> I agree with you.<br /><b>A:</b> Should we send it back?<br /><b>B:</b> No, I don't want to give the waiter any trouble.<br /><b>A:</b> Should we just leave this restaurant then?<br /><b>B:</b> No, we already got here.<br /><b>A:</b> What in the world do we do then?<br /><b>B:</b> I know! Let's add chili sauce and lemon.<br /><b>A:</b> What a great idea!<br /><b>B:</b> Okay, here I go.<br /><b>A:</b> Well, how does it taste?<br /><b>B:</b> It tastes so much better.
<b>A:</b> May I have a table for three?<br /><b>B:</b> Of course. Here is your number.<br /><b>A:</b> About how long will it take you to call this number?<br /><b>B:</b> About one hour.<br /><b>A:</b> Wow, that is a really long time.<br /><b>B:</b> I apologize for the long wait.<br /><b>A:</b> Does the line go all the way outside?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, I apologize again.<br /><b>A:</b> Why can't the customers wait inside? It's freezing.<br /><b>B:</b> There are already too many people inside.<br /><b>A:</b> Forget it, I am leaving!<br /><b>B:</b> Please give us another chance!
<b>A:</b> Is it me or does this water taste weird?<br /><b>B:</b> It tastes weird.<br /><b>A:</b> I'm glad it's not just me.<br /><b>B:</b> It tastes sweet.<br /><b>A:</b> I think the staff didn't wash the glasses.<br /><b>B:</b> The customers before us probably ordered soda.<br /><b>A:</b> That's why it's so sweet!<br /><b>B:</b> Yeah, it's water mixed with soda.<br /><b>A:</b> We are drinking someone's saliva. Gross!<br /><b>B:</b> We should complain!<br /><b>A:</b> We should ask for a free drink.<br /><b>B:</b> I agree with you.
<b>A:</b> Do you want to meet up for lunch?<br /><b>B:</b> Sure, where are we going?<br /><b>A:</b> It depends. Are you a picky eater?<br /><b>B:</b> Not at all. I like almost anything.<br /><b>A:</b> What about spicy food?<br /><b>B:</b> That's my favorite kind!<br /><b>A:</b> Mine too! I know a place with very spicy hot wings.<br /><b>B:</b> Then we should go there.<br /><b>A:</b> However, it is a little bit far.<br /><b>B:</b> That's fine. I really want to try these wings.<br /><b>A:</b> Okay, then I'll send you the address.<br /><b>B:</b> See you there.
<b>A:</b> Do you want to eat something really good?<br /><b>B:</b> Yeah, of course.<br /><b>A:</b> There's this incredible Italian restaurant.<br /><b>B:</b> Okay, let's go now.<br /><b>A:</b> We'll get there in 4 hours.<br /><b>B:</b> Are you joking?<br /><b>A:</b> The restaurant is in Las Vegas, Nevada.<br /><b>B:</b> We're not going all the way there for food.<br /><b>A:</b> Why not? It will be fun!<br /><b>B:</b> There are a lot of Italian restaurants here.<br /><b>A:</b> But they are not as good.<br /><b>B:</b> Fine, we can go tomorrow.
<b>A:</b> Why are you cutting into the wall?<br /><b>B:</b> I bought a new air conditioning unit.<br /><b>A:</b> I don't think that's how you install it!<br /><b>B:</b> Have you ever installed one before?<br /><b>A:</b> No, but that still looks wrong.<br /><b>B:</b> I think I know what I'm doing.<br /><b>A:</b> I see water pipes behind that wall.<br /><b>B:</b> I don't think that's good for the air conditioner.<br /><b>A:</b> I don't think so, either.<br /><b>B:</b> Will you call some professionals now?<br /><b>A:</b> I guess that's the best thing to do.<br /><b>B:</b> You should have done so from the beginning!
<b>A:</b> I don't like the color of the walls.<br /><b>B:</b> It's a very bright color.<br /><b>A:</b> I want to repaint the whole house!<br /><b>B:</b> What color will you use?<br /><b>A:</b> I was thinking of a nice blue color.<br /><b>B:</b> That sounds very nice and soft.<br /><b>A:</b> Will you help me paint the house?<br /><b>B:</b> I think we will still need help.<br /><b>A:</b> I'll ask some others to join us.<br /><b>B:</b> Will you pay us?<br /><b>A:</b> I'll pay you with pizza and soda.<br /><b>B:</b> It's a deal! I'm hired!
<b>A:</b> What is that you're riding?<br /><b>B:</b> It's my new riding lawn mower.<br /><b>A:</b> It looks like a sporting vehicle.<br /><b>B:</b> Mowing the lawn can be a sport.<br /><b>A:</b> That doesn't sound like a very exciting sport.<br /><b>B:</b> It's exciting on a riding mower.<br /><b>A:</b> How long does it take you to finish the lawn?<br /><b>B:</b> Around twenty minutes.<br /><b>A:</b> It takes me an hour most of the time!<br /><b>B:</b> This tool is fun and convenient!<br /><b>A:</b> Can I borrow it sometime?<br /><b>B:</b> No way! A racer never lends out his racecar!
<b>A:</b> I repainted my house, so I need some new furniture.<br /><b>B:</b> What pieces are you looking for?<br /><b>A:</b> A new table, a sofa, and maybe a reading chair.<br /><b>B:</b> What's wrong with your old furniture?<br /><b>A:</b> It doesn't match the room anymore.<br /><b>B:</b> Is it still comfortable to use?<br /><b>A:</b> Yes. I think I will sell it.<br /><b>B:</b> You can also get it re-upholstered.<br /><b>A:</b> Are you crazy? That is much too expensive!<br /><b>B:</b> It depends on where you have it done.<br /><b>A:</b> I still say that takes too much effort.<br /><b>B:</b> Trying to help you takes too much effort, too.
<b>A:</b> I need a bigger closet.<br /><b>B:</b> I think you just need fewer clothes.<br /><b>A:</b> A woman can never have too many clothes.<br /><b>B:</b> She can if they don't fit in her closet!<br /><b>A:</b> Maybe we should take your things out of it.<br /><b>B:</b> Then where would I put my clothes?<br /><b>A:</b> You can put them in a small wardrobe.<br /><b>B:</b> I think it's easier if you throw some dresses out.<br /><b>A:</b> My dresses are nicer than your clothes!<br /><b>B:</b> I only have the clothes that are necessary.<br /><b>A:</b> So do I. I need to look nice more often than you do.<br /><b>B:</b> I wish your attitude was as nice as your dresses.
<b>A:</b> I am tired of living in my apartment building.<br /><b>B:</b> Didn't you just move in a few months ago?<br /><b>A:</b> Yes, but I really regret it.<br /><b>B:</b> Why do you regret it so much?<br /><b>A:</b> My neighbor is a percussionist.<br /><b>B:</b> That sounds awesome. I love the drums!<br /><b>A:</b> You wouldn't love them at three in the morning!<br /><b>B:</b> He plays that late into the night?<br /><b>A:</b> All the time! It sounds like I live in the jungle.<br /><b>B:</b> Why don't you complain to the landlord?<br /><b>A:</b> I didn't want to cause problems.<br /><b>B:</b> Your neighbor caused problems in the first place.
<b>A:</b> I want to form a secret club.<br /><b>B:</b> That sounds fun! Where would the club meet?<br /><b>A:</b> Maybe we can meet in my attic!<br /><b>B:</b> No way! It's dark up there!<br /><b>A:</b> We just need to take flashlights.<br /><b>B:</b> What if we fall through the ceiling?<br /><b>A:</b> I don't think that will happen.<br /><b>B:</b> Most attics are haunted in movies.<br /><b>A:</b> Do you really believe in ghosts?<br /><b>B:</b> No, but I don't want to risk it.<br /><b>A:</b> Maybe the attic isn't such a good idea.<br /><b>B:</b> Let's meet in the living room instead.
<b>A:</b> The pool is filthy.<br /><b>B:</b> I forgot to put on the cover last night.<br /><b>A:</b> There are mosquitoes buzzing around it!<br /><b>B:</b> They lay their eggs in the stagnant water.<br /><b>A:</b> How are we supposed to go swimming?<br /><b>B:</b> You have to wait until I clean the pool.<br /><b>A:</b> Can you clean it now?<br /><b>B:</b> I have to, before more mosquitoes hatch.<br /><b>A:</b> Try not to get bitten!<br /><b>B:</b> I'd hate to be hospitalized for a mosquito bite.<br /><b>A:</b> If you are, make sure you finish the pool first!<br /><b>B:</b> Your concern over me is heartwarming.
<b>A:</b> What is that black goo you're carrying?<br /><b>B:</b> It's roofing tar.<br /><b>A:</b> Are you replacing your shingles?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes I am. The roof has been leaking in the rain.<br /><b>A:</b> Isn't tar very messy?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, I need to be careful with it.<br /><b>A:</b> How long does it take to finish?<br /><b>B:</b> It takes several hours to replace all the shingles.<br /><b>A:</b> I think you'd better work very quickly.<br /><b>B:</b> Why do I have to work quickly?<br /><b>A:</b> It looks like it's going to rain again tonight.<br /><b>B:</b> Sometimes I think Mother Nature just likes being mean.
<b>A:</b> This is the perfect house for us!<br /><b>B:</b> It has all the bedrooms we need!<br /><b>A:</b> Each bedroom even has a bathroom!<br /><b>B:</b> The backyard is huge!<br /><b>A:</b> And we finally have a pool!<br /><b>B:</b> What's the price for this house?<br /><b>A:</b> I didn't expect it to be so high.<br /><b>B:</b> This house is hideous!<br /><b>A:</b> I agree! We should look for a different house.<br /><b>B:</b> A house like this wouldn't be so bad.<br /><b>A:</b> As long as the price tag doesn't make it hideous.<br /><b>B:</b> Let's check the price first next time.
<b>A:</b> I made a terrible mistake!<br /><b>B:</b> What's the problem?<br /><b>A:</b> I made the check for the mortgage and didn't mail it!<br /><b>B:</b> When was it due?<br /><b>A:</b> Yesterday! I thought I sent it three days ago!<br /><b>B:</b> It was just an honest mistake.<br /><b>A:</b> Do you think I can send it now?<br /><b>B:</b> Well, you have to. They may charge a late fee, though.<br /><b>A:</b> I have to be more careful when making the payments.<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, you do! I'd hate to be evicted.<br /><b>A:</b> Don't joke about things like that!<br /><b>B:</b> I'm sorry. I'll go mail the check now.
<b>A:</b> Apartments are so expensive these days.<br /><b>B:</b> Only rich people can afford to live in them.<br /><b>A:</b> My landlord raised the rent, so I'm moving out.<br /><b>B:</b> Where will you live?<br /><b>A:</b> I don't know yet, I have to search for an apartment.<br /><b>B:</b> Are you going to live alone?<br /><b>A:</b> Well, I've never had a roommate before.<br /><b>B:</b> I would find one if I were you.<br /><b>A:</b> It would be helpful in paying the rent.<br /><b>B:</b> Post an ad on Craigslist and see who replies.<br /><b>A:</b> If a psycho becomes my roommate, I'll blame you.<br /><b>B:</b> If that happens, I'll stay far away from your apartment.
<b>A:</b> My apartment is too far from work.<br /><b>B:</b> Have you considered moving?<br /><b>A:</b> I've thought about it.<br /><b>B:</b> Where would you move to?<br /><b>A:</b> I don't like the neighborhood around my job.<br /><b>B:</b> What about the next one over?<br /><b>A:</b> Then I'd be too far from school.<br /><b>B:</b> There are some apartments in between the two.<br /><b>A:</b> I went to see them, but they were too small.<br /><b>B:</b> Why don't you live in a townhouse?<br /><b>A:</b> I suppose that would be a good idea.<br /><b>B:</b> Of course it's a good idea; it was my idea!
<b>A:</b> There is garbage all over the ground!<br /><b>B:</b> Those raccoons knocked over the trash cans again.<br /><b>A:</b> I feel like calling animal control!<br /><b>B:</b> Would they take care of the problem?<br /><b>A:</b> I think they'd come and catch them.<br /><b>B:</b> What would happen to the raccoons?<br /><b>A:</b> They'd be released into the wild.<br /><b>B:</b> What if they put them to sleep?<br /><b>A:</b> I didn't think about that.<br /><b>B:</b> Maybe it's better to buy chains for the trash cans.<br /><b>A:</b> I think so, too.<br /><b>B:</b> That way, we won't kill any raccoons.
<b>A:</b> How many roommates do you have?<br /><b>B:</b> There are five of us in total.<br /><b>A:</b> Wow! Don't you ever fight?<br /><b>B:</b> Sometimes, but we try not to.<br /><b>A:</b> Who does all the household chores?<br /><b>B:</b> We take turns so that it's fair.<br /><b>A:</b> That's a good way to do things.<br /><b>B:</b> Yes it is, and it helps us get along better.<br /><b>A:</b> What about when one of you has a girlfriend over?<br /><b>B:</b> We agreed to try not to have them over too often.<br /><b>A:</b> I guess it would be a tight squeeze.<br /><b>B:</b> Too tight for any of our liking.
<b>A:</b> I can't unlock the door!<br /><b>B:</b> Maybe it's because the key is brand new.<br /><b>A:</b> The lock won't turn at all!<br /><b>B:</b> Are you sure the key is not upside down?<br /><b>A:</b> I've flipped it five times!<br /><b>B:</b> It still doesn't work?<br /><b>A:</b> No! The door is still locked.<br /><b>B:</b> Let me try to open it.<br /><b>A:</b> Maybe you'll have better luck.<br /><b>B:</b> I see what the problem is. You're using your old key!<br /><b>A:</b> Oops! I'm so used to my old house.<br /><b>B:</b> It's alright; eventually you'll get used to this one.
<b>A:</b> You sure bought a lot of Christmas lights!<br /><b>B:</b> I want the house to be shining this Christmas!<br /><b>A:</b> Do all of the houses on the block decorate?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, they do! It is quite beautiful.<br /><b>A:</b> I can't wait to see it when it's done!<br /><b>B:</b> A parade marches by every year so people can see them.<br /><b>A:</b> What are you doing on the roof?<br /><b>B:</b> I'm going to make it look like it snowed up here!<br /><b>A:</b> Are you using Christmas lights and cotton?<br /><b>B:</b> That's right. I'll install a Santa Claus, too.<br /><b>A:</b> You sure are full of Christmas spirit!<br /><b>B:</b> Of course! It only comes once a year!
<b>A:</b> The house down the street is on fire!<br /><b>B:</b> How do you know?<br /><b>A:</b> There is smoke coming up from the house!<br /><b>B:</b> Did you call 911?<br /><b>A:</b> I am going to call right now!<br /><b>B:</b> I think they're having a barbeque.<br /><b>A:</b> This is nothing to joke about!<br /><b>B:</b> No, I mean the smoke is coming from a grill.<br /><b>A:</b> Oh. That explains the delicious smell.<br /><b>B:</b> Were we invited?<br /><b>A:</b> I'm afraid we were not.<br /><b>B:</b> How sad, even after saving their burning house.
<b>A:</b> There are holes in the wood in the garage.<br /><b>B:</b> Are they big or little?<br /><b>A:</b> They are actually quite tiny.<br /><b>B:</b> That is very worrisome.<br /><b>A:</b> Why do you say that?<br /><b>B:</b> You could have termites, or carpenter ants.<br /><b>A:</b> You mean bugs could be eating my house?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes. It is a very serious problem.<br /><b>A:</b> What should I do?<br /><b>B:</b> You need to fumigate them immediately.<br /><b>A:</b> Bugs are such a hassle!<br /><b>B:</b> I wish they were all dead!
<b>A:</b> I have a big surprise for you!<br /><b>B:</b> Is it a new toy?<br /><b>A:</b> No, it's a big announcement!<br /><b>B:</b> That doesn't sound very exciting.<br /><b>A:</b> We are moving to a new house!<br /><b>B:</b> What's wrong with our apartment?<br /><b>A:</b> Well, a house is bigger.<br /><b>B:</b> Apartments are cozier.<br /><b>A:</b> You can have a dog in the new house.<br /><b>B:</b> But we already have a cat.<br /><b>A:</b> The new house has a treehouse in the backyard.<br /><b>B:</b> Now there's a big surprise! I'm so excited!
<b>A:</b> I'm planning a house warming party.<br /><b>B:</b> Is that to celebrate buying a heater?<br /><b>A:</b> Don't be so sarcastic!<br /><b>B:</b> I really don't know what that is.<br /><b>A:</b> It's so that we can meet our neighbors!<br /><b>B:</b> I don't really want to meet our neighbors.<br /><b>A:</b> Quit being so negative.<br /><b>B:</b> What do we do at this party?<br /><b>A:</b> Everyone brings a dish, and we sit, eat, and talk.<br /><b>B:</b> Sounds like a regular party.<br /><b>A:</b> It's a regular party.<br /><b>B:</b> Next time, don't call it something so strange.
<b>A:</b> My son broke a window yesterday.<br /><b>B:</b> How did he do that?<br /><b>A:</b> He said he was practicing his pitching.<br /><b>B:</b> He was pitching against the window?<br /><b>A:</b> No, against the side of the house.<br /><b>B:</b> If he missed, he's not a very good pitcher.<br /><b>A:</b> No, but he's pretty fast and can run long distances.<br /><b>B:</b> How do you know that?<br /><b>A:</b> I chased him when I found out he broke the window.<br /><b>B:</b> Well, you contributed to his training.<br /><b>A:</b> As his coach, my fee is three months of his allowance.<br /><b>B:</b> What a coincidence! That's enough for a new window.
<b>A:</b> Who let the dog inside?<br /><b>B:</b> I did. What's the problem?<br /><b>A:</b> He got mud all over the new carpet!<br /><b>B:</b> That wasn't him. I just gave him a bath!<br /><b>A:</b> Now that I look closer, these look like footprints!<br /><b>B:</b> Well, they're not mine, they're too big!<br /><b>A:</b> They're not mine, either. I haven't been outside.<br /><b>B:</b> I think those are dad's footprints.<br /><b>A:</b> I think you're right!<br /><b>B:</b> Dad's in big trouble now.<br /><b>A:</b> Yes he is. Maybe he'll sleep in the dog house tonight.<br /><b>B:</b> I don't think the dog wants dad as a roommate.
<b>A:</b> You have so many portraits on your wall!<br /><b>B:</b> I love displaying all the pictures I've taken.<br /><b>A:</b> How do you hang all the picture frames?<br /><b>B:</b> I just hang them on the wall.<br /><b>A:</b> You don't use nails, do you?<br /><b>B:</b> Well yes, I do.<br /><b>A:</b> You're not allowed to use nails in an apartment!<br /><b>B:</b> Why not?<br /><b>A:</b> It ruins the walls for the next tenant!<br /><b>B:</b> I didn't think about that!<br /><b>A:</b> You'd better use poster putty next time.<br /><b>B:</b> I'll cover all these holes with paint!
<b>A:</b> Do you think wolves are like dogs?<br /><b>B:</b> No way! Wolves are vicious.<br /><b>A:</b> A man on TV lived with wolves for many years.<br /><b>B:</b> Didn't they eat him?<br /><b>A:</b> No, he is still alive, and he loves wolves.<br /><b>B:</b> That is so amazing!<br /><b>A:</b> Maybe people have the wrong idea about them.<br /><b>B:</b> Probably. They're always bad in children's books.<br /><b>A:</b> I've never heard of a wolf eating a person in real life.<br /><b>B:</b> Neither have I.<br /><b>A:</b> I think I like wolves.<br /><b>B:</b> I still don't think they're like dogs, though.

My shirt makes it worse.<br /><b>B:</b> It's too bad we're in school.
<b>A:</b> I can't wait for spring to come.<br /><b>B:</b> What is so special about the spring?<br /><b>A:</b> The weather is warm in the spring.<br /><b>B:</b> It is also warm in the summer.<br /><b>A:</b> There are mosquitos in the summer.<br /><b>B:</b> There are no mosquitoes in the fall.<br /><b>A:</b> But fall isn't warm like summer is.<br /><b>B:</b> And winter is even colder.<br /><b>A:</b> That's why I think spring is the perfect season.<br /><b>B:</b> I think I prefer the summer.<br /><b>A:</b> What about the mosquitoes?<br /><b>B:</b> I'll wear bug repellant.
<b>A:</b> I think I stepped on a snail.<br /><b>B:</b> Did you feel something crunch under your shoes?<br /><b>A:</b> Yes. It feels disgusting.<br /><b>B:</b> Clean your shoes on the grass.<br /><b>A:</b> There are snails everywhere!<br /><b>B:</b> They like to eat the plants here.<br /><b>A:</b> Do they make holes in the leaves?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, they make a lot of holes in the leaves.<br /><b>A:</b> If they were faster, maybe they could hunt for food.<br /><b>B:</b> What could they hunt? They have no teeth.<br /><b>A:</b> Neither does my grandma.<br /><b>B:</b> Your grandma is not a snail.
<b>A:</b> Does it snow in your hometown?<br /><b>B:</b> Sometimes, when it's very cold.<br /><b>A:</b> I've never seen snow. What is it like?<br /><b>B:</b> Sometimes it's white, fluffy, and looks like clouds.<br /><b>A:</b> That sounds so romantic.<br /><b>B:</b> Other times, it is wet and slushy.<br /><b>A:</b> Can you use it to make snowballs?<br /><b>B:</b> Only the fluffy snow.<br /><b>A:</b> Why not the slushy snow?<br /><b>B:</b> Those snowballs would hurt!<br /><b>A:</b> I thought that all snowballs hurt.<br /><b>B:</b> Not if you use freshly fallen snow.
<b>A:</b> I wish I were a bird.<br /><b>B:</b> I think being a cat would be better.<br /><b>A:</b> But birds can fly.<br /><b>B:</b> Well, cats can climb.<br /><b>A:</b> Birds fly higher than any cats can climb.<br /><b>B:</b> And yet, cats eat birds all the time.<br /><b>A:</b> That's only when the bird is sleeping.<br /><b>B:</b> You just don't want to admit cats are better.<br /><b>A:</b> I know why you want to be a cat.<br /><b>B:</b> Why do I want to be a cat?<br /><b>A:</b> Cats sleep all day, and so do you.<br /><b>B:</b> At least cats can sleep without being eaten.
<b>A:</b> Why are you spraying pesticides?<br /><b>B:</b> To kill the insects in the garden.<br /><b>A:</b> Not all insects are bad.<br /><b>B:</b> They are ruining my vegetables.<br /><b>A:</b> You should buy the right kind of poison.<br /><b>B:</b> What do you mean?<br /><b>A:</b> Some poisons kill bees.<br /><b>B:</b> That's alright. Bees sting people.<br /><b>A:</b> Without bees, your garden will not have fruit.<br /><b>B:</b> Why is that?<br /><b>A:</b> Bees pollinate the flowers so fruit can grow.<br /><b>B:</b> Help me pick out a pesticide that is safe for bees.
<b>A:</b> I would like to have a garden.<br /><b>B:</b> Planting a garden is a lot of work.<br /><b>A:</b> But then you grow beautiful flowers.<br /><b>B:</b> Plastic flowers don't die, and they are also beautiful.<br /><b>A:</b> Plastic flowers don't have a scent.<br /><b>B:</b> You can spray them with perfume.<br /><b>A:</b> Perfume doesn't really smell like flowers.<br /><b>B:</b> It does if you buy the right kind.<br /><b>A:</b> It is expensive to buy perfume and plastic flowers.<br /><b>B:</b> I suppose you are right.<br /><b>A:</b> Will you help me plant my garden?<br /><b>B:</b> I don't think I have any other choice.
<b>A:</b> Aren't waterfalls beautiful?<br /><b>B:</b> I think they're terrifying.<br /><b>A:</b> Why do they scare you?<br /><b>B:</b> People fall off them all the time.<br /><b>A:</b> Do they live?<br /><b>B:</b> Of course not.<br /><b>A:</b> As long as you don't swim in them, you're safe.<br /><b>B:</b> They are still dangerous.<br /><b>A:</b> People are the ones who make the danger.<br /><b>B:</b> I suppose you're right.<br /><b>A:</b> Do you still think they're terrifying?<br /><b>B:</b> A little, but they're beautiful, too.
<b>A:</b> Which is the lightning and which is the thunder?<br /><b>B:</b> Lightning lights up the sky.<br /><b>A:</b> And what about thunder?<br /><b>B:</b> Thunder makes the big booming noise.<br /><b>A:</b> I thought they both made noise.<br /><b>B:</b> No, only thunder makes noise.<br /><b>A:</b> Can people be hit by thunder?<br /><b>B:</b> No, people can only be hit by lightning.<br /><b>A:</b> Do you think they get magical powers?<br /><b>B:</b> That is impossible.<br /><b>A:</b> Such things happen in movies all the time.<br /><b>B:</b> You watch too much television.
<b>A:</b> I won't be in town this weekend.<br /><b>B:</b> Neither will I.<br /><b>A:</b> I'm going on a camping trip. What are you doing?<br /><b>B:</b> I will be visiting my grandma.<br /><b>A:</b> I think camping will be more fun.<br /><b>B:</b> Why don't you take me with you?<br /><b>A:</b> I don't think your parents will allow it.<br /><b>B:</b> You are probably right, but I want to go.<br /><b>A:</b> I'll bring you back a souvenir.<br /><b>B:</b> I don't want it. I want to go, too.<br /><b>A:</b> You can't always get what you want.<br /><b>B:</b> I hope you get eaten by a bear.
<b>A:</b> The forecast said it would rain tomorrow.<br /><b>B:</b> Why do you sound so excited?<br /><b>A:</b> We have a big PE test tomorrow.<br /><b>B:</b> I didn't know that.<br /><b>A:</b> We have to run ten kilometers.<br /><b>B:</b> I think that is next week.<br /><b>A:</b> Then what are we doing tomorrow?<br /><b>B:</b> I think we will be playing street hockey.<br /><b>A:</b> Hockey is my favorite sport!<br /><b>B:</b> Too bad it may rain.<br /><b>A:</b> I hope it doesn't rain, after all.<br /><b>B:</b> You change your mind very quickly.
<b>A:</b> Have you ever heard of poison ivy?<br /><b>B:</b> Isn't that a super villain?<br /><b>A:</b> I wouldn't know. Tell me more.<br /><b>B:</b> I once read about Poison Ivy in a comic book.<br /><b>A:</b> Oh, no. That's not what I'm talking about.<br /><b>B:</b> Then what did you mean?<br /><b>A:</b> I was talking about the plant.<br /><b>B:</b> Is it the one that makes you itch?<br /><b>A:</b> Yes. I fell into a patch of it.<br /><b>B:</b> Did you wash it off?<br /><b>A:</b> Yes, but it still itches.<br /><b>B:</b> The Poison Ivy I think of is better than this poison ivy.
<b>A:</b> What was that sound?<br /><b>B:</b> What sound?<br /><b>A:</b> It sounded like a whistle.<br /><b>B:</b> I didn't hear anything.<br /><b>A:</b> The sound came from you!<br /><b>B:</b> I admit it, I made the sound.<br /><b>A:</b> How did you do that?<br /><b>B:</b> I made a whistle with a blade of grass.<br /><b>A:</b> Teach me how to do it!<br /><b>B:</b> Why do you want to learn?<br /><b>A:</b> I want to surprise my sister when I get home.<br /><b>B:</b> You're a mean older sister.
<b>A:</b> Put the rock back where you found it.<br /><b>B:</b> But I like the rock, mommy.<br /><b>A:</b> So do the animals that live here.<br /><b>B:</b> The animals have many rocks. I just want one.<br /><b>A:</b> But animals need the rocks, and you don't.<br /><b>B:</b> What do they need them for?<br /><b>A:</b> Some animals make their homes with rocks.<br /><b>B:</b> Very small animals?<br /><b>A:</b> Yes. You might be taking someone's ceiling!<br /><b>B:</b> I don't want to ruin their homes.<br /><b>A:</b> Good. Please put it back.<br /><b>B:</b> I'll go leave it where I found it.
<b>A:</b> That cloud looks just like a horse!<br /><b>B:</b> No, it doesn't; it looks like a cloud!<br /><b>A:</b> You're supposed to use your imagination.<br /><b>B:</b> It still looks like a cloud.<br /><b>A:</b> Try to see another shape in it.<br /><b>B:</b> Alright, let's look at a different cloud.<br /><b>A:</b> I think that one looks like a hippo.<br /><b>B:</b> I don't see a hippo.<br /><b>A:</b> What do you see, then?<br /><b>B:</b> I see a cloud.<br /><b>A:</b> I told you to use your imagination!<br /><b>B:</b> In that case, I see a cotton ball.
<b>A:</b> Mom, are there animals in the forest?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, there are many different kinds.<br /><b>A:</b> Then why haven't we seen any?<br /><b>B:</b> They are probably hiding.<br /><b>A:</b> Why are they hiding?<br /><b>B:</b> Animals are afraid of people.<br /><b>A:</b> Maybe if we hold still, they will come out.<br /><b>B:</b> Why is that?<br /><b>A:</b> They will think we are trees.<br /><b>B:</b> I think they will know we're not trees.<br /><b>A:</b> Can we try it and see?<br /><b>B:</b> No, dear. Let's keep walking.
<b>A:</b> I went to an interesting rave last night.<br /><b>B:</b> What was so interesting about it?<br /><b>A:</b> It was called a silent rave.<br /><b>B:</b> How can you have a rave without music?<br /><b>A:</b> Everyone wears headphones and dances to the music.<br /><b>B:</b> That doesn't sound very fun.<br /><b>A:</b> It is very convenient.<br /><b>B:</b> How can it be convenient?<br /><b>A:</b> To talk to someone, you just take off the earphones.<br /><b>B:</b> Wow! That does sound convenient.<br /><b>A:</b> Best of all, I got a cute girl's phone number.<br /><b>B:</b> Now I see why you liked the rave so much!
<b>A:</b> How are you enjoying the party?<br /><b>B:</b> Well, the food is good.<br /><b>A:</b> You don't sound very excited.<br /><b>B:</b> The party isn't very exciting.<br /><b>A:</b> It's only as exciting as you make it!<br /><b>B:</b> There's really nothing to do here.<br /><b>A:</b> The music will start in a while.<br /><b>B:</b> I don't really know how to dance…<br /><b>A:</b> That's fine!

I wouldn't have found it!<br /><b>B:</b> It's no problem.
<b>A:</b> That is a beautiful dress you are wearing.<br /><b>B:</b> Thank you. It was a gift from my husband.<br /><b>A:</b> He has excellent taste.<br /><b>B:</b> It's because he knows exactly what I like.<br /><b>A:</b> I wish my husband had your husband's taste in fashion.<br /><b>B:</b> Doesn't he know what you like?<br /><b>A:</b> Hardly.

<b>A:</b> Is that the costume you made for the expo?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, it is. I can't wait to wear it!<br /><b>A:</b> How long did it take you to make it?<br /><b>B:</b> I spent several weeks on it.<br /><b>A:</b> It looks amazing!<br /><b>B:</b> Thank you. I plan to enter it in the contest.<br /><b>A:</b> I'm sure you will win a prize.<br /><b>B:</b> I hope so; I want to get some of my money back.<br /><b>A:</b> Was it very expensive to make?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, but the quality makes it worth it.<br /><b>A:</b> I definitely agree with you.<br /><b>B:</b> Thank you.

I don't know anyone yet.<br /><b>A:</b> No, but I think you will get along.<br /><b>B:</b> I hope so. I'm shy around strangers.<br /><b>A:</b> Just be confident. You'll make a lot of new friends here.<br /><b>B:</b> I'll try that. Thank you for the invitation.<br /><b>A:</b> No problem. We'll pick you up at 8:00.
<b>A:</b> I've never been to an amusement park.<br /><b>B:</b> Amusement parks are fun!<br /><b>A:</b> What is there to do there?<br /><b>B:</b> There are lots of games to play, and rides to enjoy.<br /><b>A:</b> Is it expensive to go to one?<br /><b>B:</b> It depends on how much you spend during the day.<br /><b>A:</b> What about admission?<br /><b>B:</b> Admission prices depend on the park.<br /><b>A:</b> I would like to go to one.<br /><b>B:</b> Just make sure you don't eat before riding the rides!<br /><b>A:</b> Why not?<br /><b>B:</b> Just trust me, it will ruin your day.

It's mostly for fun.
<b>A:</b> What are you wearing to the banquet tomorrow?<br /><b>B:</b> I'm not sure yet. What about you?<br /><b>A:</b> I saw a dress I liked, but it was very expensive.<br /><b>B:</b> Maybe you can get a job to raise the money.<br /><b>A:</b> I don't think I'll make enough money to buy it on time.<br /><b>B:</b> Women's clothing is so expensive.<br /><b>A:</b> Tell me about it.<br /><b>B:</b> Men's suits can be expensive, too.<br /><b>A:</b> Maybe I can rent a nice dress.<br /><b>B:</b> That's a great idea! Where can you do that?<br /><b>A:</b> I'll just find a store online and then go pick up the clothes.<br /><b>B:</b> Give me the website so I can rent my dress, too.
<b>A:</b> The prices on fruit have really gone up this year!<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, they have. It's ridiculous!<br /><b>A:</b> The fruit is not of good quality, either.<br /><b>B:</b> You're right; these apples are bruised.<br /><b>A:</b> These bananas are too green to be eaten.<br /><b>B:</b> Fifty cents each is too expensive for bad bananas.<br /><b>A:</b> The quality of life is going down in general.<br /><b>B:</b> I blame it on the economy.<br /><b>A:</b> The state of the economy has been terrible.<br /><b>B:</b> I hope products are better quality soon.<br /><b>A:</b> It's like they say, 'cheap things are often more expensive.'<br /><b>B:</b> I totally agree with you.
<b>A:</b> How are you enjoying your evening?<br /><b>B:</b> I am enjoying it very much, thank you.<br /><b>A:</b> How did you come to meet the host?<br /><b>B:</b> We work for the same company.<br /><b>A:</b> What is your line of work?<br /><b>B:</b> We deal with private investments.<br /><b>A:</b> That sounds like such an important job!<br /><b>B:</b> That makes it stressful at times.<br /><b>A:</b> How do you deal with the stress?<br /><b>B:</b> It's easier when you have good friends around.<br /><b>A:</b> I agree wholeheartedly!<br /><b>B:</b> After all, friendship makes the world go round.
<b>A:</b> Do you know John's address?<br /><b>B:</b> No, I don't. Why do you need it?<br /><b>A:</b> I want to invite his son to my daughter's party.<br /><b>B:</b> Wow, how old will she be?<br /><b>A:</b> She will be four next week.<br /><b>B:</b> Children grow like weeds.<br /><b>A:</b> Yes, they do. His son is almost five now.<br /><b>B:</b> Why doesn't she give it to him at school?<br /><b>A:</b> I am afraid one of them will lose it.<br /><b>B:</b> Send John a message and ask him his address.<br /><b>A:</b> I guess I will have to.<br /><b>B:</b> Either way, I'm sure they will come to the party.
<b>A:</b> I feel so sleepy this morning.<br /><b>B:</b> Why are you so tired? It's not like you.<br /><b>A:</b> I was working late last night and didn't get much sleep.<br /><b>B:</b> Maybe you should drink some coffee.<br /><b>A:</b> I hear coffee stunts your growth.<br /><b>B:</b> That's only if you drink it when you're young.<br /><b>A:</b> Coffee also stains your teeth brown.<br /><b>B:</b> Just rinse your mouth when you finish drinking it.<br /><b>A:</b> It's too hot to drink coffee, anyways.<br /><b>B:</b> There are also iced coffee drinks you can try.<br /><b>A:</b> I guess an iced coffee does sound pretty good.<br /><b>B:</b> It's my treat. Maybe once you have some, you'll be more interesting to talk to.
<b>A:</b> Doesn't that new Godzilla movie look good?<br /><b>B:</b> The effects are much better than in the old movies.<br /><b>A:</b> The storyline sounds interesting, too.<br /><b>B:</b> Do you want to go watch it now?<br /><b>A:</b> Alright! I'll check the show times.<br /><b>B:</b> When is the closest show time?<br /><b>A:</b> There's one showing in fifteen minutes, and another in an hour.<br /><b>B:</b> The theater is more than fifteen minutes away.<br /><b>A:</b> Let's go to the one in an hour, then.<br /><b>B:</b> We'll still have some time before it starts.<br /><b>A:</b> That's okay. We can have lunch while we wait.<br /><b>B:</b> We'd better get going if we're going to make it on time.
<b>A:</b> Let's go to the mall.<br /><b>B:</b> What for?<br /><b>A:</b> I would like to buy a new sweater.<br /><b>B:</b> Didn't you just buy one last week?<br /><b>A:</b> Yes, but it was too small.<br /><b>B:</b> It looked fine to me.<br /><b>A:</b> Maybe to you, but I felt like a sausage while wearing it.<br /><b>B:</b> Are you going to exchange it?<br /><b>A:</b> No. I gave it to my sister.<br /><b>B:</b> Will you buy the same one?<br /><b>A:</b> Of course not!<br /><b>B:</b> Okay, let's go find you a sweater.
<b>A:</b> You should put away those chips.<br /><b>B:</b> Why? I'm hungry.<br /><b>A:</b> You'll leave crumbs everywhere.<br /><b>B:</b> Someone will pick them up.<br /><b>A:</b> Probably roaches and vermin.<br /><b>B:</b> There are no roaches on the bus!<br /><b>A:</b> That's only because people work to keep things clean.<br /><b>B:</b> You're exaggerating.<br /><b>A:</b> There are signs saying no food on the bus.<br /><b>B:</b> No one takes those signs seriously.<br /><b>A:</b> Imagine if everyone left crumbs and trash on the bus.<br /><b>B:</b> I guess I should not make a mess at least.
<b>A:</b> Plane tickets are so expensive!<br /><b>B:</b> I can't afford to fly to San Francisco.<br /><b>A:</b> Well, we can always go by bus.<br /><b>B:</b> There's a bus that drives to San Francisco?<br /><b>A:</b> There are buses that drive to any nearby state.<br /><b>B:</b> That sounds perfect! How much is the fare?<br /><b>A:</b> Usually one-fifth of what a plane ticket costs.<br /><b>B:</b> How do we buy tickets?<br /><b>A:</b> If we buy them online, they're even cheaper.<br /><b>B:</b> What bus line do I search?<br /><b>A:</b> Greyhound buses are the most popular.<br /><b>B:</b> I'm so glad we'll have a trip after all!
<b>A:</b> Hello! It's nice to meet you!<br /><b>B:</b> Hello, likewise.<br /><b>A:</b> Are you taking the bus downtown?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, I am. I'm doing some shopping.<br /><b>A:</b> Oh, so am I! Prices are so much better there.<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, they are.<br /><b>A:</b> The weather is very nice today, at least.<br /><b>B:</b> I'm glad for that. It's nice for walking about.<br /><b>A:</b> Heatwaves are so unfortunate. They drain my energy!<br /><b>B:</b> I know what you mean.<br /><b>A:</b> Would you like to join me while shopping today?<br /><b>B:</b> I just remembered, I have to get off at the next stop.
<b>A:</b> I just missed my bus!<br /><b>B:</b> Oh no! What are you going to do?<br /><b>A:</b> I don't know! The next one comes in ten minutes!<br /><b>B:</b> You won't make it to work on time.<br /><b>A:</b> What should I do?<br /><b>B:</b> Ask the next bus driver for help.<br /><b>A:</b> How can he possibly help me?<br /><b>B:</b> He could tell you which bus to ride.<br /><b>A:</b> Do you think it's alright to ride a different bus?<br /><b>B:</b> Sure, as long as you get to work on time.<br /><b>A:</b> I just hope I don't get lost.<br /><b>B:</b> You won't. Besides, it's good not to sit idly by.
<b>A:</b> I'm so tired!<br /><b>B:</b> Me, too! That's the longest flight I've ever ridden.<br /><b>A:</b> Where's our hotel?<br /><b>B:</b> I have the address right here.<br /><b>A:</b> It's not too far. We can take the bus.<br /><b>B:</b> Actually, we can't.<br /><b>A:</b> Why we can't?<br /><b>B:</b> The bus will not allow us to carry large luggage.<br /><b>A:</b> That's so inconvenient!<br /><b>B:</b> It's because it'll take up space on the bus.<br /><b>A:</b> How do we get to the hotel, then?<br /><b>B:</b> I guess we'll have to call a taxi.
<b>A:</b> Excuse me! I need a ticket.<br /><b>B:</b> You owe me a dollar.<br /><b>A:</b> I already put one in!<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, and you owe me another.<br /><b>A:</b> The counter says fare is one dollar!<br /><b>B:</b> The fare counter tells how much money you've inserted.<br /><b>A:</b> I don't understand.<br /><b>B:</b> It reads one dollar because you put in a dollar.<br /><b>A:</b> How do I know I've paid the fare?<br /><b>B:</b> The counter will go back to zero.<br /><b>A:</b> Oh, I see what you mean.<br /><b>B:</b> Now that you've paid your two dollars, here's your ticket.
<b>A:</b> There are so many bus stops!<br /><b>B:</b> Each bus has a specific stop it goes to.<br /><b>A:</b> How do I know which stop to wait at?<br /><b>B:</b> It's written on the bus schedule.<br /><b>A:</b> Where can I find the bus schedule?<br /><b>B:</b> You can look it up online.<br /><b>A:</b> Everything is online nowadays.<br /><b>B:</b> Yes. It makes things convenient.<br /><b>A:</b> What happens if I'm at the wrong stop?<br /><b>B:</b> You can check the destination on each bus.<br /><b>A:</b> What if it doesn't help and I'm still lost?<br /><b>B:</b> Ask a bus driver for help.
<b>A:</b> Hey, you need to wake up now.<br /><b>B:</b> Where am I?<br /><b>A:</b> You're at the last stop on the route.<br /><b>B:</b> What?! How did we get so far?<br /><b>A:</b> You fell asleep and didn't request a stop.<br /><b>B:</b> I was supposed to get off three stops ago!<br /><b>A:</b> I didn't know. All I do is drive the bus.<br /><b>B:</b> How can I get back from here?<br /><b>A:</b> A bus going back will arrive soon.<br /><b>B:</b> That's good. I'd hate to be stranded.<br /><b>A:</b> Make sure you don't fall asleep this time!<br /><b>B:</b> Trust me, I'll never fall asleep again!
<b>A:</b> We only have to ride for one stop.<br /><b>B:</b> Yeah, then we have a bus transfer.<br /><b>A:</b> Let's sit here by the door.<br /><b>B:</b> I don't think we should sit there.<br /><b>A:</b> Why don't you want to sit there?<br /><b>B:</b> Those seats are reserved for the handicapped and elderly.<br /><b>A:</b> Are all the seats next to the exits reserved?<br /><b>B:</b> I think they are. They have signs beside them.<br /><b>A:</b> All the seats close to those are taken.<br /><b>B:</b> Just choose any seat.<br /><b>A:</b> Oh, look! We're there already.<br /><b>B:</b> I suppose standing wasn't so bad anyway.
<b>A:</b> My tap card isn't working!<br /><b>B:</b> Why not? Try it again.<br /><b>A:</b> It's still not accepting the fare.<br /><b>B:</b> Is the magnetic strip broken?<br /><b>A:</b> No, I just used it at the station.<br /><b>B:</b> Did it run out of credit?<br /><b>A:</b> No, I just refilled it yesterday.<br /><b>B:</b> Did you tap it upside-down?<br /><b>A:</b> I tried flipping it several times.<br /><b>B:</b> Look, you're using a metro card.<br /><b>A:</b> What's the problem with that?<br /><b>B:</b> This is the Montebello bus line!
<b>A:</b> There are so many bus lines here!<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, there are! I still get confused sometimes.<br /><b>A:</b> How do you know which buses to get on?<br /><b>B:</b> I check the schedules at each bus stop.<br /><b>A:</b> That is so convenient!<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, it is. It helps to keep me from getting lost.<br /><b>A:</b> So many bus lines can be confusing.<br /><b>B:</b> The buses pass by very frequently.<br /><b>A:</b> How often do they pass by?<br /><b>B:</b> Maybe once every 10 to 15 minutes.<br /><b>A:</b> I feel like I'll never get stranded here!<br /><b>B:</b> Definitely not! Just make sure you have a ticket!
<b>A:</b> What time is it?<br /><b>B:</b> The sun just rose.<br /><b>A:</b> How many more hours are left?<br /><b>B:</b> Maybe two more hours.<br /><b>A:</b> That's good. I'm hungry.<br /><b>B:</b> I'm feeling hungry, too.<br /><b>A:</b> My neck hurts from sleeping in a bad position.<br /><b>B:</b> Next time, maybe we should bring pillows.<br /><b>A:</b> Definitely! Then my head won't bounce around.<br /><b>B:</b> At least you're not carsick.<br /><b>A:</b> You're carsick?<br /><b>B:</b> It's better not to talk about it.
<b>A:</b> Why didn't you buy a bus ticket?<br /><b>B:</b> I have a tap card.<br /><b>A:</b> What is a tap card?<br /><b>B:</b> It stores money for me to use when I ride the bus.<br /><b>A:</b> Is it like a credit card?<br /><b>B:</b> It works exactly like a credit card.<br /><b>A:</b> How did the bus driver know you had one?<br /><b>B:</b> I tapped it on his ticket console.<br /><b>A:</b> I see. That is much faster!<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, and much more convenient.<br /><b>A:</b> Maybe I'll get myself a tap card.<br /><b>B:</b> You should. You'd save time and money.
<b>A:</b> Oh no! I lost my ticket!<br /><b>B:</b> Was it an all-day pass?<br /><b>A:</b> Yes! I just bought it!<br /><b>B:</b> What are you going to do?<br /><b>A:</b> Well, I guess all I need to do is get home.<br /><b>B:</b> It takes three transfers to get to your house.<br /><b>A:</b> Maybe I'll just hop the bus.<br /><b>B:</b> No way! You have to buy another ticket!<br /><b>A:</b> It's not a big deal. No one will notice.<br /><b>B:</b> You'd better not. You could get in trouble.<br /><b>A:</b> I feel like I'm wasting my money!<br /><b>B:</b> A $2 ticket is better than a $150 ticket fine.
<b>A:</b> This line is so long!<br /><b>B:</b> We've been waiting for almost an hour!<br /><b>A:</b> I guess they do a really thorough check.<br /><b>B:</b> What are they checking for?<br /><b>A:</b> They need to make sure no one is carrying any weapons.<br /><b>B:</b> I'm glad they check thoroughly for that!<br /><b>A:</b> They also have to make sure no one has drugs.<br /><b>B:</b> Wow! I guess that's why the police dogs are here.<br /><b>A:</b> Look! There are only three people ahead.<br /><b>B:</b> After that, can we board the bus?<br /><b>A:</b> Yes. We're almost there.<br /><b>B:</b> Good! I'm tired of standing in line!
<b>A:</b> Where do I buy my bus ticket?<br /><b>B:</b> You buy it in the bus.<br /><b>A:</b> Isn't there a station?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, but that's not where you buy tickets.<br /><b>A:</b> Does the bus driver give me my ticket?<br /><b>B:</b> The bus driver has a machine that does.<br /><b>A:</b> Do I buy a new ticket every time I ride the bus?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, but if you plan to ride several buses, buy a day pass.<br /><b>A:</b> Why should I buy a day pass?<br /><b>B:</b> It would be cheaper than buying several tickets.<br /><b>A:</b> So I just wait for the bus to get here?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, and make sure you have change.
<b>A:</b> At what time does the Montebello bus leave?<br /><b>B:</b> It leaves every ten minutes.<br /><b>A:</b> Do you know when the next one is coming?<br /><b>B:</b> Well, you actually just missed it.<br /><b>A:</b> You mean I have to wait ten whole minutes?!<br /><b>B:</b> Unfortunately. Sometimes, though, it's a little faster.<br /><b>A:</b> I wonder if I'll still have enough time for shopping.<br /><b>B:</b> You only have a few minutes to buy something.<br /><b>A:</b> I'm in a bit of a hurry.<br /><b>B:</b> You should try to find different bus routes.<br /><b>A:</b> Is it easy to navigate bus routes?<br /><b>B:</b> Very easy. Here's a map for you to read.
<b>A:</b> There are so many buses going to Montebello.<br /><b>B:</b> There are many places in Montebello.<br /><b>A:</b> How do I know which bus to take?<br /><b>B:</b> First, choose where you want to go in Montelello.<br /><b>A:</b> Alright, then what's next?<br /><b>B:</b> Read the list of Montebello buses going to that stop.<br /><b>A:</b> There are three. How do I choose one?<br /><b>B:</b> They're all going to the same place?<br /><b>A:</b> Yes, it looks like they are.<br /><b>B:</b> Then choose the bus based on the timetable.<br /><b>A:</b> This is the bus that gets me there the soonest.<br /><b>B:</b> You'd better get moving; it'll be here soon!
<b>A:</b> I like a window seat!<br /><b>B:</b> Why are you always so excited about sitting there?<br /><b>A:</b> I like being able to look outside.<br /><b>B:</b> You walk along the streets all the time.<br /><b>A:</b> That's true, but this way it's like a movie.<br /><b>B:</b> What do you mean it's like a movie?<br /><b>A:</b> I like watching the people walking by.<br /><b>B:</b> All people walk the same way, you know.<br /><b>A:</b> Perhaps, but not all people live the same way.<br /><b>B:</b> What does this have to do with a window seat?<br /><b>A:</b> I just like looking out at the world.<br /><b>B:</b> Suppose the world is rather peaceful.
<b>A:</b> What bus do we need to take?<br /><b>B:</b> We need to take the Metro.<br /><b>A:</b> The metro bus stop isn't here!<br /><b>B:</b> No, I meant the Metro Gold Line.<br /><b>A:</b> I've never ridden that bus line before.<br /><b>B:</b> It's not a bus, it's a Metrolink train.<br /><b>A:</b> Why do we need to take the train?<br /><b>B:</b> It'll take us to Pasadena faster.<br /><b>A:</b> How will it do that?<br /><b>B:</b> Trains have fewer stops and never get stuck in traffic.<br /><b>A:</b> That sounds very convenient!<br /><b>B:</b> It is. Hurry and buy your tap card.
<b>A:</b> This bus is amazing!<br /><b>B:</b> It's so big!<br /><b>A:</b> The seats are comfortable, too.<br /><b>B:</b> I didn't know they had outlets and Wifi!<br /><b>A:</b> These buses are as comfortable as possible.<br /><b>B:</b> Let's look for a seat with an outlet.<br /><b>A:</b> Look! There's one there.<br /><b>B:</b> It looks like it's already taken.<br /><b>A:</b> I guess we have to be faster next time.<br /><b>B:</b> I found one!<br /><b>A:</b> Sit down, quickly!<br /><b>B:</b> We're all set for our trip now!
<b>A:</b> The man getting on the bus is in a wheelchair.<br /><b>B:</b> The driver has to adjust the seats.<br /><b>A:</b> What will he do to them?<br /><b>B:</b> He'll move them out of the way.<br /><b>A:</b> They look difficult to move.<br /><b>B:</b> Maybe we should help him.<br /><b>A:</b> What do I do?<br /><b>B:</b> Just release the lever under the seat.<br /><b>A:</b> Now what do I do?<br /><b>B:</b> Let's push the seats out of the way.<br /><b>A:</b> The driver and man are so grateful!<br /><b>B:</b> We should always try to help others.
<b>A:</b> Excuse me!<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, how can I help you?<br /><b>A:</b> I can't find the muni bus I'm looking for.<br /><b>B:</b> Well, the letters flash on the sign as they arrive.<br /><b>A:</b> That's the problem- I don't see the 8x muni.<br /><b>B:</b> Oh! There's been a misunderstanding.<br /><b>A:</b> What do you mean?<br /><b>B:</b> The line you're looking for is actually a bus line.<br /><b>A:</b> Oh! Where can I take it?<br /><b>B:</b> Just go out to the stop on the street.<br /><b>A:</b> It's a little confusing to have a muni bus and muni train!<br /><b>B:</b> Just remember, if it has a number, it's a muni bus!
<b>A:</b> Hi! Sorry I took so long to meet you.<br /><b>B:</b> That's alright, we have plenty of time.<br /><b>A:</b> Who is that girl sleeping on your shoulder?<br /><b>B:</b> She's just someone else riding the bus.<br /><b>A:</b> You mean you don't know her?<br /><b>B:</b> No. She boarded after I did and fell asleep.<br /><b>A:</b> Don't you mind her leaning on your shoulder?<br /><b>B:</b> No, I don't. She must be exhausted.<br /><b>A:</b> What if she misses her stop?<br /><b>B:</b> I heard her say she's going to Main Street.<br /><b>A:</b> Hey, that's our stop, too!<br /><b>B:</b> Yeah, so just let her sleep. It'll be fine.
<b>A:</b> Take out your student ID card.<br /><b>B:</b> Why do you need it?<br /><b>A:</b> If you show it to the driver, your ticket costs less.<br /><b>B:</b> That is very helpful to students!<br /><b>A:</b> Yes, saving every little bit counts.<br /><b>B:</b> He charged me a whole dollar less!<br /><b>A:</b> Yes, bus drivers are nice to students.<br /><b>B:</b> I wish I'd known to do it sooner.<br /><b>A:</b> Me too. We would have saved some money.<br /><b>B:</b> Does it work for college students, too?<br /><b>A:</b> I think so, as long as you show a school ID.<br /><b>B:</b> I'd better tell my big brother, too!
<b>A:</b> That child just won't stop crying!<br /><b>B:</b> It's been crying for the last three stops!<br /><b>A:</b> The mother has tried feeding it already.<br /><b>B:</b> I guess she can't change a diaper on the bus.<br /><b>A:</b> I read once that babies' ears hurt on the bus.<br /><b>B:</b> Why do their ears hurt?<br /><b>A:</b> It's because of the air pressure in the bus.<br /><b>B:</b> Is it like when your ears hurt on a plane?<br /><b>A:</b> Well, my ears hurt, too.<br /><b>B:</b> I don't think that's because of air pressure.<br /><b>A:</b> I can't stand it anymore! Let's get off now.<br /><b>B:</b> Alright. That screeching is getting to me, too.
<b>A:</b> Do you like baseball?<br /><b>B:</b> I've never watched a game.<br /><b>A:</b> You've never even seen it on television?<br /><b>B:</b> I don't own a television set.<br /><b>A:</b> We should go watch a game one day.<br /><b>B:</b> Where can we watch a baseball game?<br /><b>A:</b> In a baseball stadium.<br /><b>B:</b> There are entire stadiums just for playing baseball?<br /><b>A:</b> Yes! They even wrote a song about it.<br /><b>B:</b> I never knew it was such a popular sport!<br /><b>A:</b> Do you want to go play catch in the park?<br /><b>B:</b> Sounds good to me!
<b>A:</b> Excuse me.<br /><b>B:</b> Hello! How can I help you?<br /><b>A:</b> I am interested in buying a membership card.<br /><b>B:</b> That's great! How did you hear about us?<br /><b>A:</b> A friend of mine has a membership with you.<br /><b>B:</b> What services are you interested in?<br /><b>A:</b> I would like to have access to the swimming pool.<br /><b>B:</b> Would you also like to work out in the gym?<br /><b>A:</b> Yes, I would.<br /><b>B:</b> Here is a listing of our prices.<br /><b>A:</b> I think this plan is best for me.<br /><b>B:</b> Alright! Just fill out this paperwork, and that's all!
<b>A:</b> I'm so sore from running!<br /><b>B:</b> Maybe you've been practicing too hard.<br /><b>A:</b> I want to do well on the big race next week!<br /><b>B:</b> After all that practicing, you'll be too tired to run!<br /><b>A:</b> I won't. I'm trying to get faster, though.<br /><b>B:</b> You're pretty fast.<br /><b>A:</b> I feel like my grandma can run faster than me!<br /><b>B:</b> You just have to believe in yourself and you'll do well.<br /><b>A:</b> I always get nervous before races.<br /><b>B:</b> Maybe you should run distance races instead.<br /><b>A:</b> Do you really think I have good endurance?<br /><b>B:</b> Of course! Otherwise, you couldn't train this hard.
<b>A:</b> Great shirt! Go Dodgers!<br /><b>B:</b> It's great to find a fellow fan!<br /><b>A:</b> Do you think we have a chance at winning this year?<br /><b>B:</b> Of course! The coach will not let us down!<br /><b>A:</b> Have you ever been to an actual game?<br /><b>B:</b> I try to go at least once every season.<br /><b>A:</b> What's it like?<br /><b>B:</b> It's a great experience! Children love going to the stadium.<br /><b>A:</b> Maybe I'll take my son to a game.<br /><b>B:</b> Just keep an eye out for flying balls!<br /><b>A:</b> I'd be more worried about cavities from sweets.<br /><b>B:</b> It's just a baseball game! You're supposed to pig out.
<b>A:</b> Are you going to camp this summer?<br /><b>B:</b> I don't think so.<br /><b>A:</b> Why not?<br /><b>B:</b> I'm kind of traumatized from last year.<br /><b>A:</b> What happened last year?<br /><b>B:</b> I got a cramp while swimming and almost drowned.<br /><b>A:</b> I thought you took swimming lessons last semester.<br /><b>B:</b> I did, but I'm still afraid. Anything could happen.<br /><b>A:</b> You just have to trust in your abilities.<br /><b>B:</b> Do you really think I'll be okay?<br /><b>A:</b> I know you will. You swim like a fish now!<br /><b>B:</b> Thanks for your encouragement. I think I will go, after all!
<b>A:</b> I'm surprised to see you out running.<br /><b>B:</b> I want to join the track team next semester.<br /><b>A:</b> Is that why you're training so hard?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes. I want to be in shape for tryouts.<br /><b>A:</b> You don't just run to get in shape.<br /><b>B:</b> What should I do then?<br /><b>A:</b> You should do some weight training, too.<br /><b>B:</b> What good is weight training?<br /><b>A:</b> It will give you strong legs so you can run well.<br /><b>B:</b> If my legs get too muscular, I'll look like a frog!<br /><b>A:</b> Frogs are pretty fast.<br /><b>B:</b> That's true. Maybe as a frog, I'd win all the races.
<b>A:</b> You sure are buying a lot of stuff!<br /><b>B:</b> It's all the equipment I need for basketball.<br /><b>A:</b> What do you need besides a ball and a hoop?<br /><b>B:</b> All good players have a good pair of shoes.<br /><b>A:</b> That makes three things.<br /><b>B:</b> You should also wear comfortable clothes when you play.<br /><b>A:</b> What about all that candy you're buying?<br /><b>B:</b> A player has to stay energized!<br /><b>A:</b> I don't think it's good to run on sugar.<br /><b>B:</b> Then I'll eat it while I'm watching the basketball game.<br /><b>A:</b> Are you watching it on television?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes. There's a big game on Sunday.
<b>A:</b> You've been watching a lot of soccer lately.<br /><b>B:</b> There's a different game shown every day.<br /><b>A:</b> That's because of the world cup.<br /><b>B:</b> Everyone is talking about it all the time!<br /><b>A:</b> Have you watched every single game?<br /><b>B:</b> No, I only watch the really important teams.<br /><b>A:</b> How do you choose which teams are important?<br /><b>B:</b> Well, I cheer for the countries my parents are from.<br /><b>A:</b> What other teams do you cheer for?<br /><b>B:</b> Well, this country's team, of course.<br /><b>A:</b> How do you choose from all the other teams?<br /><b>B:</b> That's easy. I cheer for the one with the cutest players!
<b>A:</b> Our skates are so different!<br /><b>B:</b> What do you mean?<br /><b>A:</b> Your wheels are all in a line, and mine are not!<br /><b>B:</b> Oh, that's because these are roller blades.<br /><b>A:</b> They look difficult to use.<br /><b>B:</b> They just go a little faster.<br /><b>A:</b> Our skates show our differences in personality!<br /><b>B:</b> Why are you saying that?<br /><b>A:</b> Yours are sharp and sporty, but mine are cute and practical!<br /><b>B:</b> I'll try to take that as a compliment.<br /><b>A:</b> Anyways, let's get back to skating!<br /><b>B:</b> Let's go.
<b>A:</b> Hi! You're David's mom, aren't you?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes I am. Do I know you from somewhere?<br /><b>A:</b> I'm James's mom. They play on the same team.<br /><b>B:</b> That's right! It's nice to meet you.<br /><b>A:</b> It's nice to meet you, too.<br /><b>B:</b> Will David be playing in the big game on Saturday?<br /><b>A:</b> I'm afraid not. He's fighting a cold.<br /><b>B:</b> That's terrible! A bug has been going around.<br /><b>A:</b> He's missed a lot of school, though.<br /><b>B:</b> I see. I'll ask David to deliver his homework.<br /><b>A:</b> That would be a great help, thank you.<br /><b>B:</b> It's no problem at all!
<b>A:</b> This is a weird looking golf club.<br /><b>B:</b> That's not a golf club.<br /><b>A:</b> What is it, then?<br /><b>B:</b> It's a hockey stick.<br /><b>A:</b> Is hockey that game the men play on ice?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes it is. It's a difficult game.<br /><b>A:</b> It reminds me a lot of soccer.<br /><b>B:</b> I think hockey is more difficult than soccer.<br /><b>A:</b> Why do you think that?<br /><b>B:</b> Well, you have to skate. Soccer is just kicking.<br /><b>A:</b> I think there is more to it than that.<br /><b>B:</b> Either way, I'd be terrible at both!
<b>A:</b> What are those men doing with brooms?<br /><b>B:</b> I think those are special brushes.<br /><b>A:</b> Are they going to clean the ice?<br /><b>B:</b> It looks like this is some kind of sport event.<br /><b>A:</b> Look, they're sweeping in front of that rock!<br /><b>B:</b> The Internet says that the sport is called "curling."<br /><b>A:</b> It doesn't seem like a real sport to me.<br /><b>B:</b> Me, neither.

<b>A:</b> Do you like my new bicycle?<br /><b>B:</b> It looks very sporty!<br /><b>A:</b> It's a racing bike. I bought it so I could be in the triathlon.<br /><b>B:</b> Wow!

I've been playing for five years and I'm okay.<br /><b>A:</b> Is that why you are missing your front teeth?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes. But it's not that bad.<br /><b>A:</b> It looks painful.<br /><b>B:</b> A little. Everything else about Hockey is fun.<br /><b>A:</b> Cool, but I'll stick to golf.

They were practicing after school yesterday.<br /><b>B:</b> Were they using a birdie?<br /><b>A:</b> Of course not! That'd be animal abuse!<br /><b>B:</b> A birdie is a plastic, red-nosed tool for badminton.<br /><b>A:</b> Oh, I see. Yes, they were using a red tool.<br /><b>B:</b> Then the sport you saw was definitely badminton.<br /><b>A:</b> Is that also why the rackets were so small and thin?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes.

It would be hard to control a bouncy ball.<br /><b>B:</b> My ball is a little flat, though.<br /><b>A:</b> We'd better fill it up. If we don't, it won't even roll.<br /><b>B:</b> Have you seen the air pump?

You never know what could hurt you.

Let's get going.<br /><b>B:</b> Lead the way!

<b>A:</b> Did you hear about the dog ban?<br /><b>B:</b> No, what dog are they banning?<br /><b>A:</b> The city wants to ban pit-bulls.<br /><b>B:</b> What? Why do they want to do that?<br /><b>A:</b> They say pit-bulls are dangerous.<br /><b>B:</b> Pit-bulls are only trained to be that way.<br /><b>A:</b> How should they fix the attack problem, then?<br /><b>B:</b> I think there should be a background check for dog adoption.<br /><b>A:</b> How would that fix anything?<br /><b>B:</b> If good people adopt them, the dogs will be good.<br /><b>A:</b> Many still feel like they're in danger around pit-bulls.<br /><b>B:</b> I feel more endangered being around people than pit-bulls.

I'll do it, too.<br /><b>B:</b> Besides, I think it looks pretty cute, too!

We're in the middle of traffic.<br /><b>A:</b> It doesn't matter, but it is against the law.<br /><b>B:</b> No one will see me do it.<br /><b>A:</b> If you get used to it, you may casually check it later.<br /><b>B:</b> I'm sure nothing will happen if I do that.<br /><b>A:</b> One day, you may check it at the wrong time.<br /><b>B:</b> Stop saying things like that.<br /><b>A:</b> I'm just trying to make you see the danger in it.<br /><b>B:</b> What should I do, then?

I feel like we've been everywhere.<br /><b>B:</b> You can always go to a place more than once.<br /><b>A:</b> No, it's too boring.<br /><b>B:</b> If you're with someone you like, the location doesn't matter.<br /><b>A:</b> Maybe I should break up with my boyfriend.<br /><b>B:</b> I thought you two had chemistry.<br /><b>A:</b> We don't.

Stop lying to me.<br /><b>B:</b> Fine, you are right.<br /><b>A:</b> You should give him a chance.<br /><b>B:</b> I just think dating a short guy is weird.<br /><b>A:</b> Get past his appearance.

I really want to know.<br /><b>B:</b> He has to come to my door with roses.<br /><b>A:</b> And then what?<br /><b>B:</b> He has to open the door of a limousine.<br /><b>A:</b> Then where are you going to go?<br /><b>B:</b> A fancy restaurant with an ocean view.<br /><b>A:</b> That sounds nice.<br /><b>B:</b> We would eat lobster.<br /><b>A:</b> How would your date end?<br /><b>B:</b> With fireworks and dessert.

<b>A:</b> Are you sure you want to go to Seattle?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, I am sure.<br /><b>A:</b> It's an eight-hour drive.<br /><b>B:</b> I know. Let's go.<br /><b>A:</b> If you say so.<br /><b>B:</b> I'll drive for the first four hours.<br /><b>A:</b> I'll drive for the last four hours.<br /><b>B:</b> Did you bring food?<br /><b>A:</b> I brought sandwiches and bottles of water.<br /><b>B:</b> Good.

<b>A:</b> Are you nervous for your driving test?<br /><b>B:</b> Yeah, I don't want to fail.<br /><b>A:</b> You won't. You have been practicing a lot.<br /><b>B:</b> There's one thing I was never good at.<br /><b>A:</b> What is that one thing?<br /><b>B:</b> Right turns.<br /><b>A:</b> What's wrong with your right turns?<br /><b>B:</b> They're too wide.<br /><b>A:</b> We can practice right now.<br /><b>B:</b> You would do that for me?<br /><b>A:</b> Of course! I want you to pass.<br /><b>B:</b> Alright, let's do this.
<b>A:</b> Excuse me! Can you please help me?<br /><b>B:</b> What's the problem?<br /><b>A:</b> My car stopped in the middle of the road.<br /><b>B:</b> Did you run out of gas?<br /><b>A:</b> Yes, I think I did.<br /><b>B:</b> There is no gas station within walking distance.<br /><b>A:</b> May I please borrow your phone?<br /><b>B:</b> Are you planning to call a tow service?<br /><b>A:</b> Yes, I think it's all I can do.<br /><b>B:</b> If you'd like, I'll drive you to the station.<br /><b>A:</b> Thank you so much!<br /><b>B:</b> It's no problem. Let's get going.
<b>A:</b> My car was stolen.<br /><b>B:</b> I am so sorry to hear that.<br /><b>A:</b> Did you happen to see anything suspicious yesterday?<br /><b>B:</b> Well, I did see a man looking at your car.<br /><b>A:</b> What time did you see this man?<br /><b>B:</b> I saw him at about 2:00 p.m.<br /><b>A:</b> I wasn't home at that time.<br /><b>B:</b> Then, the man I saw could be the criminal!<br /><b>A:</b> What did he look like?<br /><b>B:</b> I couldn't really see his face.<br /><b>A:</b> I'll never find the criminal.<br /><b>B:</b> I hope you have a good insurance plan.
<b>A:</b> I cleaned my car yesterday.<br /><b>B:</b> It's not clean anymore.<br /><b>A:</b> What happened?<br /><b>B:</b> Take a look.<br /><b>A:</b> Oh, no! There's bird poop.<br /><b>B:</b> That's unfortunate, since you just washed it.<br /><b>A:</b> Can you wash my car?<br /><b>B:</b> I'll wash it for $15.<br /><b>A:</b> This can be your birthday gift to me.<br /><b>B:</b> It's a deal.<br /><b>A:</b> Have fun washing the poop off.<br /><b>B:</b> Sometimes I wonder why we're friends.
<b>A:</b> Is your seatbelt on?<br /><b>B:</b> Of course, it is.<br /><b>A:</b> I can tell you're lying.<br /><b>B:</b> Fine! The truth is, I never put my seatbelt on.<br /><b>A:</b> Why not? That's so dangerous.<br /><b>B:</b> It feels so uncomfortable.<br /><b>A:</b> Say that after you get into a car accident.<br /><b>B:</b> I'm never going to get into an accident.<br /><b>A:</b> There's another reason you should put your seatbelt on.<br /><b>B:</b> And that is?<br /><b>A:</b> You're going to get a ticket.<br /><b>B:</b> Really? Fine, I'll put my seatbelt on.
<b>A:</b> You have not driven in a month.<br /><b>B:</b> I just like staying at home these days.<br /><b>A:</b> What is really going on?<br /><b>B:</b> Honestly, I'm scared of getting into an accident.<br /><b>A:</b> You weren't scared two months ago.<br /><b>B:</b> My best friend got into a car accident.<br /><b>A:</b> Accidents do happen, but not if you're careful.<br /><b>B:</b> I'm just scared.<br /><b>A:</b> You shouldn't be.<br /><b>B:</b> If it happened to my friend, it can happen to me.<br /><b>A:</b> So you're just going to never drive?<br /><b>B:</b> I'll drive when I'm ready.
<b>A:</b> Why is the guy behind me honking?<br /><b>B:</b> You are going too slow.<br /><b>A:</b> I am driving at the speed limit!<br /><b>B:</b> Everyone drives fast in this town.<br /><b>A:</b> No one follows the rule?<br /><b>B:</b> You're the only one.<br /><b>A:</b> I should yell at him.<br /><b>B:</b> No, he'll just be even more mad.<br /><b>A:</b> Good! He deserves to be mad.<br /><b>B:</b> You don't know if he's dangerous.<br /><b>A:</b> I'll just go even slower.<br /><b>B:</b> That would really annoy him.
<b>A:</b> Why are you driving so fast?<br /><b>B:</b> I have to be at work on time.<br /><b>A:</b> Do you really have to?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, I will be fired if I'm late.<br /><b>A:</b> I don't want to die.<br /><b>B:</b> Relax, I am a good driver.<br /><b>A:</b> A good driver doesn't drive extremely fast.<br /><b>B:</b> We haven't even hit anything yet.<br /><b>A:</b> I bet you're going to get a ticket.<br /><b>B:</b> How much do you want to bet?<br /><b>A:</b> If I win, you're never driving me.<br /><b>B:</b> If I win, you have to shut up whenever I drive.
<b>A:</b> Dad, I don't have my own car.<br /><b>B:</b> Your mom and I talked to you about this.<br /><b>A:</b> I wasn't paying attention.<br /><b>B:</b> We don't have enough money for a new car.<br /><b>A:</b> Can't we just take some loans?<br /><b>B:</b> You can just use the old car.<br /><b>A:</b> It's so ugly though.<br /><b>B:</b> Money doesn't grow on trees.<br /><b>A:</b> Everyone at school has a new car.<br /><b>B:</b> Get a job and buy one yourself.<br /><b>A:</b> But no one wants to hire me.<br /><b>B:</b> Then you're going to have to drive an old car.
<b>A:</b> Do you like my new car?<br /><b>B:</b> Yeah, but it's a little plain.<br /><b>A:</b> What should I do to make it less plain?<br /><b>B:</b> Decorate it. That's what I did.<br /><b>A:</b> I know! I'll put stuffed animals in the back.<br /><b>B:</b> You can also get a steering wheel cover.<br /><b>A:</b> I might as well get matching seat covers too.<br /><b>B:</b> I'll give you my sister's seat and steering wheel covers.<br /><b>A:</b> Are they new?<br /><b>B:</b> Yeah, she never used them.<br /><b>A:</b> Thanks! How much do you want for them?<br /><b>B:</b> Consider the covers your birthday present.
<b>A:</b> My license plate number came in today.<br /><b>B:</b> Do you like it?<br /><b>A:</b> It's just some random numbers and letters.<br /><b>B:</b> You should customize it.<br /><b>A:</b> I can do that?<br /><b>B:</b> Yeah, I did.<br /><b>A:</b> What does yours say?<br /><b>B:</b> Mine says "Cali95."<br /><b>A:</b> Why did you choose that?<br /><b>B:</b> I love California, and I was born in 1995.<br /><b>A:</b> That is pretty clever!<br /><b>B:</b> Thanks! You could do something similar.
<b>A:</b> Where do you want to go?<br /><b>B:</b> How about Santa Anita Mall?<br /><b>A:</b> I don't know how to drive there.<br /><b>B:</b> Do you have a map?<br /><b>A:</b> Yes, but I don't know how to read it.<br /><b>B:</b> Try calling someone for directions.<br /><b>A:</b> I lost my phone yesterday.<br /><b>B:</b> You are so unlucky.<br /><b>A:</b> Do you want to go anywhere else?<br /><b>B:</b> Yeah, surprise me.<br /><b>A:</b> Okay, I know this really fun place.<br /><b>B:</b> Great! I can't wait.
<b>A:</b> The traffic in this lane is terrible.<br /><b>B:</b> Why do you think that is?<br /><b>A:</b> Probably some car accident.<br /><b>B:</b> You should switch to another lane.<br /><b>A:</b> Okay, I'll switch to the right lane.<br /><b>B:</b> Wait! There's a car coming!<br /><b>A:</b> That was scary. I almost hit that car.<br /><b>B:</b> How could you not see that?<br /><b>A:</b> I didn't look in the rear-view mirror.<br /><b>B:</b> You are such a bad driver.<br /><b>A:</b> Hey! Everybody makes mistakes.<br /><b>B:</b> I think it's only you who make such mistakes.
<b>A:</b> I used to work in a deli.<br /><b>B:</b> How did you like it?<br /><b>A:</b> I loved it!<br /><b>B:</b> Did you get free food?<br /><b>A:</b> I ate free cheese and meat every day.<br /><b>B:</b> That sounds like a great job.<br /><b>A:</b> Whatever a customer ordered, I sliced off a little more for me.<br /><b>B:</b> Did you get fat?<br /><b>A:</b> No, but I did put on a few pounds.<br /><b>B:</b> That sounds like a dream job.<br /><b>A:</b> It was, until one day my manager caught me.<br /><b>B:</b> No more free cheese for you, huh?
<b>A:</b> My girlfriend's mom got mad at me at the dinner table.<br /><b>B:</b> Why was that?<br /><b>A:</b> I sprinkled salt and pepper on the food before I tasted it.<br /><b>B:</b> What's the matter with that?<br /><b>A:</b> Her mom is a great cook.<br /><b>B:</b> So, a little salt and pepper never hurt anything.<br /><b>A:</b> It hurt her feelings.<br /><b>B:</b> Oh.<br /><b>A:</b> I apologized to her, but I could tell she was still upset.<br /><b>B:</b> Maybe you shouldn't eat there again.<br /><b>A:</b> I'm sure everything will be okay in a day or two.<br /><b>B:</b> It's your girlfriend's fault. She should have warned you.
<b>A:</b> I love salads.<br /><b>B:</b> Me too.<br /><b>A:</b> I usually eat a simple salad.<br /><b>B:</b> What do you put in it?<br /><b>A:</b> Just lettuce, tomato, and celery.<br /><b>B:</b> That's it?<br /><b>A:</b> I add some pepper and salt.<br /><b>B:</b> I always put cheese in my salads.<br /><b>A:</b> Yes, cheese is nice.<br /><b>B:</b> What kind of dressing do you use?<br /><b>A:</b> I pour lots of French dressing on top.<br /><b>B:</b> Me too. French dressing is so delicious! Who cares about calories?
<b>A:</b> I'm on a new diet.<br /><b>B:</b> What are you eating now?<br /><b>A:</b> I switched from pasta to potatoes.<br /><b>B:</b> Why did you do that?<br /><b>A:</b> Pasta is processed food. Potatoes are natural food.<br /><b>B:</b> Natural food has more vitamins.<br /><b>A:</b> And it's just as easy to prepare.<br /><b>B:</b> How do you prepare the potatoes?<br /><b>A:</b> I wash them, and then steam them for 15 minutes.<br /><b>B:</b> That's pretty simple.<br /><b>A:</b> Then I add butter, salt, and pepper.<br /><b>B:</b> Can I have all those cans of tomato sauce you bought for your pasta?
<b>A:</b> I love cheese.<br /><b>B:</b> Me too.<br /><b>A:</b> Where does cheese come from?<br /><b>B:</b> It comes from cows.<br /><b>A:</b> So we get cheese from cows, and we get milk, too?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, we do.<br /><b>A:</b> What else do we get from cows?<br /><b>B:</b> We get hamburgers and steak.<br /><b>A:</b> Oh, that's so delicious.<br /><b>B:</b> We also get leather.<br /><b>A:</b> We get a lot of things from cows, don't we?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes. A cow is man's best friend.
<b>A:</b> There's something wrong with my orange.<br /><b>B:</b> What's wrong?<br /><b>A:</b> It's not orange!<br /><b>B:</b> Your orange isn't orange?<br /><b>A:</b> No, it's dark pink!<br /><b>B:</b> Are you sure? I never heard of such a thing.<br /><b>A:</b> I just peeled it, and I'm looking at it right now.<br /><b>B:</b> Let me see. Yes, you're right. Your orange is pink.<br /><b>A:</b> Who ever heard of such a thing?<br /><b>B:</b> Oh, look. Here's the little sticker that was on it. It's called a Pink Navel.<br /><b>A:</b> What is this world coming to?<br /><b>B:</b> Who knows? Maybe soon we'll have pink bananas.
<b>A:</b> I eat the same thing every day.<br /><b>B:</b> You're kidding.<br /><b>A:</b> No, I'm serious.<br /><b>B:</b> Doesn't that get old?<br /><b>A:</b> No, because I'm eating food that I like.<br /><b>B:</b> But the same thing day after day gets old.<br /><b>A:</b> Well, I guess if it ever does get old, I'll change to something different.<br /><b>B:</b> Do you eat fruits and vegetables every day?<br /><b>A:</b> No, I hate vegetables.<br /><b>B:</b> But you eat fruits.<br /><b>A:</b> I eat two apples, one banana, and one orange every day.<br /><b>B:</b> Well, there's nothing wrong with that.
<b>A:</b> I saw what you did.<br /><b>B:</b> I didn't do anything.<br /><b>A:</b> Oh yes, you did.<br /><b>B:</b> What are you talking about?<br /><b>A:</b> You know what I'm talking about.<br /><b>B:</b> I don't have any idea.<br /><b>A:</b> You know what you did.<br /><b>B:</b> Maybe I know, but how could you know?<br /><b>A:</b> Because I was watching you.<br /><b>B:</b> Okay, I'm sorry I did it.<br /><b>A:</b> Don't drink milk out of the carton. Use a glass!<br /><b>B:</b> I promise I'll never drink out of the carton again.
<b>A:</b> I'm stuffed.<br /><b>B:</b> Of course you are. You ate everything on the table.<br /><b>A:</b> I don't like to eat leftovers.<br /><b>B:</b> I'm glad to hear there's something you don't like to eat.<br /><b>A:</b> I like my food hot and fresh.<br /><b>B:</b> You like to see it disappear.<br /><b>A:</b> I don't like it reheated.<br /><b>B:</b> Well, you'll have hot fresh food tomorrow night.<br /><b>A:</b> I'm so full I'm going to burst.<br /><b>B:</b> You should loosen your belt.<br /><b>A:</b> I already loosened my belt and unbuttoned my pants.<br /><b>B:</b> Well, don't stand up, please.
<b>A:</b> I'm gaining weight.<br /><b>B:</b> How much have you gained?<br /><b>A:</b> Three pounds just this month.<br /><b>B:</b> Do you know why?<br /><b>A:</b> I think it's the ice cream.<br /><b>B:</b> You started eating ice cream?<br /><b>A:</b> It was on sale.<br /><b>B:</b> How much did you buy?<br /><b>A:</b> I filled up my freezer with ice cream.<br /><b>B:</b> Well, it won't last forever.<br /><b>A:</b> No, I figure I'll finish it all by next week.<br /><b>B:</b> Then you can start losing weight, if there isn't another sale.
<b>A:</b> I love peanuts.<br /><b>B:</b> Me, too. I love them roasted and salted.<br /><b>A:</b> I love boiled peanuts.<br /><b>B:</b> Boiled? I never heard of that.<br /><b>A:</b> Just boil raw peanuts in salt water until the shells are soft.<br /><b>B:</b> I'll have to try them sometime.<br /><b>A:</b> They're best when they're hot.<br /><b>B:</b> My brother is allergic to peanuts.<br /><b>A:</b> That's not good.<br /><b>B:</b> No, it isn't. He almost died when he was little.<br /><b>A:</b> I guess he has to be very careful about what he eats.<br /><b>B:</b> He has a very strict diet.
<b>A:</b> Boy, it's chilly outside, isn't it?<br /><b>B:</b> It sure is.<br /><b>A:</b> In fact, it's chilly in the apartment, too.<br /><b>B:</b> Let's turn on the heat.<br /><b>A:</b> I'll check to make sure that all the windows are shut.<br /><b>B:</b> It should be warmer in a few minutes.<br /><b>A:</b> It's so nice to have a heated apartment.<br /><b>B:</b> How did they survive in the old days?<br /><b>A:</b> They had fireplaces.<br /><b>B:</b> Someone had to chop the wood.<br /><b>A:</b> And carry it into the house.<br /><b>B:</b> All we have to do is flip a switch.
<b>A:</b> This is a nice neighborhood.<br /><b>B:</b> The streets are clean and quiet.<br /><b>A:</b> The neighbors don't party on the weekends.<br /><b>B:</b> People take care of their lawns.<br /><b>A:</b> No rusty old cars are sitting in the front yards.<br /><b>B:</b> We never have to call the police about anything.<br /><b>A:</b> Our kids are completely safe.<br /><b>B:</b> So why are we selling our house?<br /><b>A:</b> They're building a 3-story apartment building on the corner.<br /><b>B:</b> So we've got to sell before property values go down?<br /><b>A:</b> Yes. I still can't believe our city council allowed this building.<br /><b>B:</b> They're probably getting something under the table.
<b>A:</b> Bears are invading our neighborhoods.<br /><b>B:</b> Of course they are. They're starving to death.<br /><b>A:</b> They should stay in the woods where they belong.<br /><b>B:</b> There's no food in the woods.<br /><b>A:</b> Can't they eat grass?<br /><b>B:</b> Do you think a bear is a cow?<br /><b>A:</b> Well, I've seen them eating berries.<br /><b>B:</b> Berries aren't in season all year round.<br /><b>A:</b> It's too dangerous for kids and pets.<br /><b>B:</b> People need to cover their trash cans.<br /><b>A:</b> The police need to shoot all the bears.<br /><b>B:</b> You don't solve a problem by shooting it.
<b>A:</b> I hate looking for an apartment.<br /><b>B:</b> Me, too.<br /><b>A:</b> We have a 2 o'clock appointment to see the one on Main Street.<br /><b>B:</b> We'd better get ready to go.<br /><b>A:</b> It's an upstairs unit.<br /><b>B:</b> That's good, because I don't want to live under people with loud feet.<br /><b>A:</b> And it's a corner unit.<br /><b>B:</b> That's great. We won't have neighbors on both sides of us.<br /><b>A:</b> No pets are allowed.<br /><b>B:</b> Perfect. We don't have to listen to barking dogs.<br /><b>A:</b> And there are only six units in the whole building.<br /><b>B:</b> Where's the checkbook? I'm ready to rent it without even seeing it.
<b>A:</b> That is a beautiful house.<br /><b>B:</b> I don't like it.<br /><b>A:</b> What's the matter with it?<br /><b>B:</b> It's on the corner.<br /><b>A:</b> So?<br /><b>B:</b> That means it gets twice as much traffic.<br /><b>A:</b> You're right.<br /><b>B:</b> When you're inside, you will always hear cars stopping and stopping at the intersection.<br /><b>A:</b> Or you'll hear the collision if someone doesn't stop.<br /><b>B:</b> Or you'll see the collision if they crash into the house.<br /><b>A:</b> Let's find a house that's at the end of a dead end.<br /><b>B:</b> That's perfect. The less traffic, the better.
<b>A:</b> I really like this house.<br /><b>B:</b> Can we afford it?<br /><b>A:</b> They want 20 percent down.<br /><b>B:</b> That's a lot of money.<br /><b>A:</b> But the house is so nice.<br /><b>B:</b> It's in a great neighborhood.<br /><b>A:</b> It's close to the beach.<br /><b>B:</b> It's close to the freeways.<br /><b>A:</b> It's got a big yard.<br /><b>B:</b> The kids love the house, too.<br /><b>A:</b> If we don't buy it, someone else will.<br /><b>B:</b> You're right. Let's buy it now. We can worry later.
<b>A:</b> We can't afford this house.<br /><b>B:</b> Are you sure?<br /><b>A:</b> We will be house rich, but cash poor.<br /><b>B:</b> What do you mean?<br /><b>A:</b> Our monthly payments will be too high.<br /><b>B:</b> We won't have any money for other things?<br /><b>A:</b> No, we won't have money for gas or food.<br /><b>B:</b> We'll be eating peanut butter sandwiches?<br /><b>A:</b> Without the peanut butter!<br /><b>B:</b> That's no good!<br /><b>A:</b> We have to find a cheaper house.<br /><b>B:</b> Of course. We can't live without gas or peanut butter.
<b>A:</b> Do you like this house?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, it's beautiful.<br /><b>A:</b> It's perfect for us and the kids.<br /><b>B:</b> Three bedrooms, three bathrooms, and a big back yard.<br /><b>A:</b> And we can afford it!<br /><b>B:</b> So are we going to buy it?<br /><b>A:</b> I'm afraid not.<br /><b>B:</b> It's too far from your job, isn't it?<br /><b>A:</b> I can't spend four hours on the road every day.<br /><b>B:</b> By the time you get home, you'll be too tired to even eat.<br /><b>A:</b> I won't be able to play with the kids.<br /><b>B:</b> No, we have to find something closer to your job.
<b>A:</b> Did you call the manager?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes. He said he'd come over tomorrow.<br /><b>A:</b> Did he say what time?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes. He said he'd be here at 9 o'clock.<br /><b>A:</b> Did he understand what the problem is?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes. I told him our doorbell doesn't work.<br /><b>A:</b> It shouldn't take him long to fix it.<br /><b>B:</b> I don't even know why we need to fix it.<br /><b>A:</b> In case we have visitors.<br /><b>B:</b> But they can just knock on the door.<br /><b>A:</b> Actually, I want him to look at our carpet, too.<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, it would be nice if he'd give us a new carpet.
<b>A:</b> That was a huge fire in Santa Barbara.<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, it was.<br /><b>A:</b> They said about 30 houses burned to the ground.<br /><b>B:</b> And they were expensive houses.<br /><b>A:</b> I feel so sorry for those people.<br /><b>B:</b> Why feel sorry for rich people?<br /><b>A:</b> I feel sorry for anyone who loses their home.<br /><b>B:</b> So do I, but not if they're rich.<br /><b>A:</b> What does that have to do with it?<br /><b>B:</b> Rich people think they're better than us.<br /><b>A:</b> How many rich people do you know?<br /><b>B:</b> None.
<b>A:</b> How good is your math?<br /><b>B:</b> I can add two and two.<br /><b>A:</b> So you're not very good at math?<br /><b>B:</b> I'm terrible at math.<br /><b>A:</b> Well, I need some help.<br /><b>B:</b> With what?<br /><b>A:</b> I'm taking a math course in school.<br /><b>B:</b> Well, you should ask your teacher or your classmates for help.<br /><b>A:</b> I can't do that.<br /><b>B:</b> Why not?<br /><b>A:</b> They might think I'm stupid.<br /><b>B:</b> They're not going to think that! They'll be glad to help you.

<b>A:</b> Gravity is very important.<br /><b>B:</b> What is gravity?<br /><b>A:</b> It's the force that pulls everything down.<br /><b>B:</b> I don't understand.<br /><b>A:</b> If you pour water into a glass, the water goes down into the glass.<br /><b>B:</b> Of course it does.<br /><b>A:</b> Without gravity, the water would go up.<br /><b>B:</b> You're joking.<br /><b>A:</b> Without gravity, you would go up.<br /><b>B:</b> What do you mean?<br /><b>A:</b> You would float into the sky like a balloon.<br /><b>B:</b> That would be fun!

<b>A:</b> I don't believe the art world.<br /><b>B:</b> What is it this time?<br /><b>A:</b> An Andy Warhol drawing.<br /><b>B:</b> He's a famous artist.<br /><b>A:</b> He drew two butterflies and a flower on a napkin in a restaurant.<br /><b>B:</b> Did he sign it?<br /><b>A:</b> Yes.<br /><b>B:</b> Is it beautiful?<br /><b>A:</b> It's just black ink on a white napkin. And the napkin has food stains!<br /><b>B:</b> So it's not worth much?<br /><b>A:</b> Only about $30,000.<br /><b>B:</b> Without the food stains, it would probably be worth more.
<b>A:</b> What time does your plane leave?<br /><b>B:</b> It leaves at 12:15.<br /><b>A:</b> When do you have to be at the airport?<br /><b>B:</b> I have to be there two hours early.<br /><b>A:</b> So we have to be at the airport at 10:15.<br /><b>B:</b> That means we have to leave the house at 9:15.<br /><b>A:</b> Well, it's an hour to get there, if there are no traffic problems.<br /><b>B:</b> So maybe we better leave at 8:15?<br /><b>A:</b> Yes, it's better to get there too early than too late.<br /><b>B:</b> I agree.<br /><b>A:</b> You never know what might happen on these freeways.<br /><b>B:</b> There's at least one huge accident every day.

<b>A:</b> I hate to fly.<br /><b>B:</b> Because of all the security?<br /><b>A:</b> No, because it hurts my ears.<br /><b>B:</b> What do you mean?<br /><b>A:</b> Every time we land or take off, my ears hurt so much.<br /><b>B:</b> That's just the altitude change, I think.<br /><b>A:</b> Whatever it is, it hurts.<br /><b>B:</b> Can't you take medicine or something for it?<br /><b>A:</b> I've tried everything, but nothing works.<br /><b>B:</b> Have you tried earplugs?<br /><b>A:</b> They don't work, either.<br /><b>B:</b> Well, be glad you're not a pilot.

We all took lots of pictures.<br /><b>B:</b> Then you flew back home that evening?<br /><b>A:</b> Yes. When we landed, TV reporters and the Army band were there.<br /><b>B:</b> That must have made you feel really special.<br /><b>A:</b> Oh, it did. There were about 300 people there to honor us.<br /><b>B:</b> Well, you all deserve it. You helped save our country.

You need to buy a ticket now.<br /><b>A:</b> But maybe prices will be cheaper in October.<br /><b>B:</b> Cheaper prices won't do you any good if there are no seats.
<b>A:</b> Some guy rowed across the Atlantic Ocean.<br /><b>B:</b> Good for him.<br /><b>A:</b> Why would he do that?<br /><b>B:</b> Did he set a new record?<br /><b>A:</b> Yes, I think he did.<br /><b>B:</b> Well, I guess that's why he did it.<br /><b>A:</b> What's the point?<br /><b>B:</b> Now he has the world record!<br /><b>A:</b> But someone's going to break it, so what good is it?<br /><b>B:</b> Well, he can enjoy it while it lasts.<br /><b>A:</b> I don't think he even got paid for it.<br /><b>B:</b> Some people do it just to do it.
<b>A:</b> I want to go on a cruise ship.<br /><b>B:</b> That sounds like fun. Where do you want to go?<br /><b>A:</b> I want to cruise to Hawaii.<br /><b>B:</b> That should be a nice trip. Lots of fun, and lots of food.<br /><b>A:</b> I have no idea how much it will cost.<br /><b>B:</b> I think it depends on the season and on your cabin.<br /><b>A:</b> Well, of course I want to go when the weather is nice.<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, you don't want to travel in winter storms.<br /><b>A:</b> And I want to get a big cabin with a view.<br /><b>B:</b> Are you going to travel alone?<br /><b>A:</b> No, my sister and I will travel together.<br /><b>B:</b> Well, you should go online and try to find a good deal.

<b>A:</b> What do we need to buy?<br /><b>B:</b> Let me look at our list.<br /><b>A:</b> I know that we need milk.<br /><b>B:</b> Nonfat.<br /><b>A:</b> Of course. What else?<br /><b>B:</b> We need cheese, bread, and ham.<br /><b>A:</b> What kind of cheese?<br /><b>B:</b> Swiss.<br /><b>A:</b> Of course, the cheese with holes in it.<br /><b>B:</b> I never used to buy Swiss cheese.<br /><b>A:</b> Why not?<br /><b>B:</b> I didn't want to pay for the holes.
<b>A:</b> I got ripped off.<br /><b>B:</b> What happened?<br /><b>A:</b> I had a car problem, so I went online.<br /><b>B:</b> Did you find a solution?<br /><b>A:</b> Yes, I did. A site I went to said they would send me the solution.<br /><b>B:</b> So, what's the problem?<br /><b>A:</b> I sent them $20 using my credit card, but they never sent me the solution.<br /><b>B:</b> What are you going to do?<br /><b>A:</b> I sent them an email asking for my money back.<br /><b>B:</b> Have you heard from them?<br /><b>A:</b> Not yet. It's been a week.<br /><b>B:</b> Well, I guess that's a $20 lesson for you.
<b>A:</b> I like that shirt.<br /><b>B:</b> So do I.<br /><b>A:</b> How much is it?<br /><b>B:</b> I don't know.

Here's another shirt just like it.<br /><b>B:</b> Does it have a price tag?<br /><b>A:</b> Yes, it does. It's only $20.<br /><b>B:</b> That's a great price.<br /><b>A:</b> I think I'll buy both of them.<br /><b>B:</b> You'd better try them on first.
<b>A:</b> I'm trying to stretch my dollars.<br /><b>B:</b> How are you doing that?<br /><b>A:</b> I started shopping at the dollar store.<br /><b>B:</b> That saves a lot of money.<br /><b>A:</b> I bought three pounds of potatoes for a dollar.<br /><b>B:</b> That's a good deal.<br /><b>A:</b> Yes, even though some of the potatoes had eyes.<br /><b>B:</b> Just put them in the fridge.<br /><b>A:</b> Also, I bought a can of cheap coffee and a bag of good coffee.<br /><b>B:</b> Why did you do that?<br /><b>A:</b> I mixed them together.<br /><b>B:</b> If the coffee still tastes okay, that's a good idea.
<b>A:</b> What are those wipes for?<br /><b>B:</b> You use them to wipe the handle of the shopping cart.<br /><b>A:</b> That's a great idea.<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, all the markets just started offering wipes to shoppers.<br /><b>A:</b> I'm going to take five wipes.<br /><b>B:</b> What do you need five of them for?<br /><b>A:</b> One to wipe the handle, and the others to wipe the produce.<br /><b>B:</b> What's the matter with the produce?<br /><b>A:</b> Do you think the bananas fell from the sky?<br /><b>B:</b> What do you mean?<br /><b>A:</b> I mean, someone used their dirty hands to pick the bananas, the apples, and the oranges.<br /><b>B:</b> Well, you better save a wipe for the dirty dollar bills you're going to pay with.
<b>A:</b> Where's the pencil sharpener?<br /><b>B:</b> Which one?<br /><b>A:</b> Any one. I need to sharpen this pencil.<br /><b>B:</b> I think there's one on the dining room table.<br /><b>A:</b> I already looked there.<br /><b>B:</b> Did you look in the desk drawer?<br /><b>A:</b> Yes, I looked there, too.<br /><b>B:</b> Don't we have about five sharpeners?<br /><b>A:</b> Yes, but they seem to have legs.<br /><b>B:</b> Tomorrow I'm going to buy an electric sharpener.<br /><b>A:</b> Get one with the rubber suction cups on the bottom.<br /><b>B:</b> Yes. That way it will stay where I put it.
<b>A:</b> I bought you a pair of pants.<br /><b>B:</b> Thank you.<br /><b>A:</b> I hope they fit.<br /><b>B:</b> I hope you kept the receipt.<br /><b>A:</b> You think they won't fit?<br /><b>B:</b> I think I've put on some weight.<br /><b>A:</b> You think?<br /><b>B:</b> Maybe a pound or two.<br /><b>A:</b> Maybe four or five pounds?<br /><b>B:</b> My waist is bigger than it was.<br /><b>A:</b> No problem. These pants have an elastic waistband.<br /><b>B:</b> You are so smart!
<b>A:</b> I need a new computer.<br /><b>B:</b> What's the matter with yours?<br /><b>A:</b> It's six years old.<br /><b>B:</b> That's pretty old.<br /><b>A:</b> It still works, but I'm going to give it to a charity.<br /><b>B:</b> Are you going to buy a desktop or laptop?<br /><b>A:</b> Oh, a laptop, of course.<br /><b>B:</b> A PC or a Mac?<br /><b>A:</b> I haven't decided yet.<br /><b>B:</b> More and more people are using Macs.<br /><b>A:</b> But 90 percent of the world uses PCs.<br /><b>B:</b> And that's not going to change anytime soon.
<b>A:</b> I need some pants.<br /><b>B:</b> I thought you just bought a pair.<br /><b>A:</b> I did.<br /><b>B:</b> What's wrong with them so soon?<br /><b>A:</b> The pants are fine, but the pocket has a huge hole in it.<br /><b>B:</b> You shouldn't carry your keys and pens in your pocket.<br /><b>A:</b> But that's what pockets are for.<br /><b>B:</b> You should carry them in a purse.<br /><b>A:</b> I'm a man, and men don't carry purses!<br /><b>B:</b> Well, you should buy pants with stronger pockets.<br /><b>A:</b> I would if I could find someone who makes strong pockets.<br /><b>B:</b> Try a Google search online.
<b>A:</b> I've got a date for you.<br /><b>B:</b> Oh, really?<br /><b>A:</b> Are you interested?<br /><b>B:</b> Maybe. What is she like?<br /><b>A:</b> She's got a great personality.<br /><b>B:</b> Uh-oh. That means that she's fat and ugly.<br /><b>A:</b> She's cute.<br /><b>B:</b> Okay, so she's not ugly; she's just fat.<br /><b>A:</b> She weighs 98 pounds.<br /><b>B:</b> Okay, she's not fat. So what's the problem with her?<br /><b>A:</b> Who said there is a problem with her?<br /><b>B:</b> The problem is she has no problems—she's too good for me!
<b>A:</b> Would you like to go on a blind date?<br /><b>B:</b> You must be joking.<br /><b>A:</b> No, I'm serious.<br /><b>B:</b> I don't want to date a blind woman.<br /><b>A:</b> A blind date doesn't mean that she is blind!<br /><b>B:</b> What does it mean?<br /><b>A:</b> A blind date is a date with someone you don't know.<br /><b>B:</b> Why would I date someone I don't even know?<br /><b>A:</b> To try something new and exciting.<br /><b>B:</b> What if I don't like her?<br /><b>A:</b> Then you don't date her again.

<b>A:</b> I have a date tomorrow night.<br /><b>B:</b> Really? Who with?<br /><b>A:</b> A girl I met at the market.<br /><b>B:</b> You met a girl at the supermarket?<br /><b>A:</b> She was standing behind me in a really slow line at the checkout counter.<br /><b>B:</b> What did you say to her?<br /><b>A:</b> I had two pineapples in my cart, and she asked where I had found them.<br /><b>B:</b> She asked you about your pineapples?<br /><b>A:</b> I told her I had gotten the last two on the shelf, but I offered her one of mine.<br /><b>B:</b> That was nice of you.<br /><b>A:</b> She asked me how she could return the favor, so I asked her out.<br /><b>B:</b> Sometimes a slow line can be a good thing.
<b>A:</b> You have pretty eyes.<br /><b>B:</b> Thank you. So do you.<br /><b>A:</b> I wish my eyes were blue.<br /><b>B:</b> What's the matter with green eyes?<br /><b>A:</b> Nothing, except my favorite color is blue.<br /><b>B:</b> Maybe in your next life you'll have blue eyes.<br /><b>A:</b> But what if I'm a fish in my next life?<br /><b>B:</b> I think some fish have blue eyes.<br /><b>A:</b> I hope I don't come back as a fish.<br /><b>B:</b> I hope I come back as a cat.<br /><b>A:</b> Cats have beautiful eyes.<br /><b>B:</b> I would love to have blue cat-eyes.
<b>A:</b> I'm in love with that girl.<br /><b>B:</b> Have you told her?<br /><b>A:</b> Of course not.<br /><b>B:</b> Why not?<br /><b>A:</b> She would laugh at me.<br /><b>B:</b> How do you know?<br /><b>A:</b> Because they always do.<br /><b>B:</b> Maybe she's different.<br /><b>A:</b> They're all the same.<br /><b>B:</b> Just ask her out to dinner.<br /><b>A:</b> And then what?<br /><b>B:</b> And then she'll know that you like her.
<b>A:</b> I don't like that man.<br /><b>B:</b> Why not?<br /><b>A:</b> He's a dirty old man.<br /><b>B:</b> What do you mean?<br /><b>A:</b> He's old enough to be my father, yet he asked me out.<br /><b>B:</b> Well, you can't blame a man for asking.<br /><b>A:</b> He should act his age.<br /><b>B:</b> But a lot of old people are still interested in dating.<br /><b>A:</b> They should find a nice hobby.<br /><b>B:</b> Just wait until you're 50 years old.<br /><b>A:</b> Dating will be the furthest thing from my mind.<br /><b>B:</b> That's what you say now. Wait till you're 50.
<b>A:</b> I think you're very pretty.<br /><b>B:</b> Thank you.<br /><b>A:</b> Would you have dinner with me?<br /><b>B:</b> I would like to.<br /><b>A:</b> Can I pick you up Friday night?<br /><b>B:</b> What time?<br /><b>A:</b> Eight o'clock.<br /><b>B:</b> That sounds great.<br /><b>A:</b> We'll go to a French restaurant.<br /><b>B:</b> I've never been to a French restaurant.<br /><b>A:</b> I think you'll love the food.<br /><b>B:</b> I'm not going to eat any snails!
<b>A:</b> Some people have good noses.<br /><b>B:</b> I wish I had a good nose. Mine is way too big.<br /><b>A:</b> I don't mean good-looking. I mean good-smelling.<br /><b>B:</b> Oh. But that can be a curse.<br /><b>A:</b> Yes, because you can be too sensitive to odors.<br /><b>B:</b> I'll say. My girlfriend has a nose like a drug dog.<br /><b>A:</b> Did she catch you using drugs?<br /><b>B:</b> Sort of. She knows whenever I sneak a cigarette.<br /><b>A:</b> You don't need a good nose for that—cigarettes stink.<br /><b>B:</b> But when I sneak just one cigarette in the morning, she can smell it that evening!<br /><b>A:</b> Boy, that is a good nose.<br /><b>B:</b> I told her she should apply for a job at customs.
<b>A:</b> Did you have a date Friday night?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, in fact, I did.<br /><b>A:</b> Who did you go out with?<br /><b>B:</b> A man I met in a coffee shop.<br /><b>A:</b> Where did you go?<br /><b>B:</b> We went to a nice restaurant.<br /><b>A:</b> Anywhere else?<br /><b>B:</b> Then we went to a jazz club.<br /><b>A:</b> That sounds like a nice date.<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, it was pleasant.<br /><b>A:</b> But you won't date him again?<br /><b>B:</b> No. He was nice, but there was no chemistry.
<b>A:</b> Give me a hug.<br /><b>B:</b> I'm not in the mood.<br /><b>A:</b> What's the matter?<br /><b>B:</b> I saw you looking at that woman.<br /><b>A:</b> What woman?<br /><b>B:</b> You know, that woman with the big boobs.<br /><b>A:</b> I was not looking at her.<br /><b>B:</b> You were, too.<br /><b>A:</b> I'm not interested in her.<br /><b>B:</b> Then why were you looking at her?<br /><b>A:</b> I was looking at something else.<br /><b>B:</b> Oh, really? Then spend tonight looking at the sofa.
<b>A:</b> I love you.<br /><b>B:</b> I love you, too.<br /><b>A:</b> I loved you the first day I saw you.<br /><b>B:</b> It was love at first sight?<br /><b>A:</b> Yes, it was love at first sight.<br /><b>B:</b> I didn't love you at first.<br /><b>A:</b> I know. I had to chase you for a while.<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, you chased me and then you caught me.<br /><b>A:</b> Now you're mine forever.<br /><b>B:</b> And you're mine forever.<br /><b>A:</b> We'll grow old together.<br /><b>B:</b> And be happy together.
<b>A:</b> Does your girlfriend ever make you angry?<br /><b>B:</b> Sometimes.<br /><b>A:</b> What does she do?<br /><b>B:</b> Just yesterday, I told her I wouldn't trade her for all the money in the world.<br /><b>A:</b> That was a nice thing to say.<br /><b>B:</b> That's what I thought.<br /><b>A:</b> What did she say?<br /><b>B:</b> She laughed! She didn't believe me.<br /><b>A:</b> That wasn't very nice of her.<br /><b>B:</b> She said that nothing is more important to me than money.<br /><b>A:</b> What did you say?<br /><b>B:</b> I told her I wouldn't trade her for any other woman in the world.

There are no guarantees.<br /><b>A:</b> If you lose your job, you can move in with me.<br /><b>B:</b> Oh, thank you. That's very nice of you.<br /><b>A:</b> You would do the same for me.<br /><b>B:</b> Of course. What are friends for?
<b>A:</b> I think I have the worst boss in the world.<br /><b>B:</b> What makes him so bad?<br /><b>A:</b> He's rude and he yells a lot.<br /><b>B:</b> That's hard to take.<br /><b>A:</b> I've never heard him say please or thank you.<br /><b>B:</b> He sounds like a real jerk.<br /><b>A:</b> No one at work likes him.<br /><b>B:</b> Can't you report him to his supervisor?<br /><b>A:</b> Of course not. If I do that, I'll lose my job.<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, they don't like troublemakers or complainers.<br /><b>A:</b> I can't quit, because I'm making a good salary.<br /><b>B:</b> You shouldn't choose money over happiness.
<b>A:</b> I'm sleepy.<br /><b>B:</b> So am I.<br /><b>A:</b> I had a long day.<br /><b>B:</b> So did I.<br /><b>A:</b> I didn't even have lunch.<br /><b>B:</b> Neither did I.<br /><b>A:</b> I was busy the whole day.<br /><b>B:</b> So was I.<br /><b>A:</b> I had to bring work home with me.<br /><b>B:</b> I did too.<br /><b>A:</b> Your day was just like mine.<br /><b>B:</b> Of course it was.

I've been here for 20 years.<br /><b>A:</b> Do you have any other skills?<br /><b>B:</b> Well, I know how to flip hamburgers.<br /><b>A:</b> No one would hire you to flip hamburgers.<br /><b>B:</b> Have you heard something that you're not telling me?<br /><b>A:</b> What do you mean?<br /><b>B:</b> Are there going to be layoffs at this place?<br /><b>A:</b> I certainly hope not!<br /><b>B:</b> If you got laid off, you'd be flipping hamburgers, too.<br /><b>A:</b> Oh great, we could both work at Burger King.<br /><b>B:</b> Maybe we'd get laid off there, too.
<b>A:</b> I don't like my job.<br /><b>B:</b> What do you do?<br /><b>A:</b> I'm a babysitter.<br /><b>B:</b> Is that a lot of work?<br /><b>A:</b> Babies cry all the time.<br /><b>B:</b> You have to change their diapers.<br /><b>A:</b> I have to feed them.<br /><b>B:</b> Are you looking for another job?<br /><b>A:</b> No, I'm looking for another family.<br /><b>B:</b> Another family?<br /><b>A:</b> A family with only one baby.<br /><b>B:</b> That's a good idea.
<b>A:</b> Before you go to that interview, check yourself.<br /><b>B:</b> What's to check?<br /><b>A:</b> Are your nails clean?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, they are.<br /><b>A:</b> Did you double-check your nose and teeth?<br /><b>B:</b> They are clean, too.<br /><b>A:</b> Did you shine your shoes?<br /><b>B:</b> My shoes are shined.<br /><b>A:</b> Do your socks match?<br /><b>B:</b> Of course they match.<br /><b>A:</b> No, they don't. One is black and one is dark blue.<br /><b>B:</b> Yikes! Thank you.
<b>A:</b> What are we going to do?<br /><b>B:</b> About what?<br /><b>A:</b> About finding a job for me.<br /><b>B:</b> You don't need a job. I make enough money for both of us.<br /><b>A:</b> That doesn't matter. I don't want to sit around.<br /><b>B:</b> Okay, what kind of job do you want?<br /><b>A:</b> I'm not sure.<br /><b>B:</b> Well, you should do something that you enjoy.<br /><b>A:</b> I enjoy selling. I was born to sell.<br /><b>B:</b> Okay, what do you want to sell?<br /><b>A:</b> Cigarette lighters. I'll make a fortune.<br /><b>B:</b> But you hate cigarettes and you hate smoking!
<b>A:</b> I need a job.<br /><b>B:</b> What was your last job?<br /><b>A:</b> I was a painter.<br /><b>B:</b> What happened?<br /><b>A:</b> I got laid off because there was no work.<br /><b>B:</b> What else can you do?<br /><b>A:</b> I'm a handyman.<br /><b>B:</b> Can you fix a dripping faucet in a kitchen sink?<br /><b>A:</b> Of course.<br /><b>B:</b> Then I have a job for you in my kitchen.<br /><b>A:</b> It will cost you only $20 plus parts.<br /><b>B:</b> Okay. That sounds like a fair price.
<b>A:</b> I was going to be a doctor.<br /><b>B:</b> What happened to your plans?<br /><b>A:</b> I got a D in college chemistry.<br /><b>B:</b> Well, a D is better than an F.<br /><b>A:</b> A tutor helped me get the D!<br /><b>B:</b> So, you didn't become a doctor.<br /><b>A:</b> And now I'm glad that I didn't.<br /><b>B:</b> Why's that?<br /><b>A:</b> A hospital is the most dangerous place in the world.<br /><b>B:</b> Oh, yes, because of all the killer germs.<br /><b>A:</b> If you're a smart doctor, you stay away from hospitals.<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, the smart doctors are those TV news doctors—no hospitals, no patients.
<b>A:</b> Life is hard.<br /><b>B:</b> It sure is.<br /><b>A:</b> I thought school was hard.<br /><b>B:</b> Me, too. I couldn't wait to graduate.<br /><b>A:</b> But now work is hard, too.<br /><b>B:</b> I agree. Work is just as hard as school.<br /><b>A:</b> Sometimes I wish I was back in school.<br /><b>B:</b> Me, too. School was fun.<br /><b>A:</b> And it was only 12 years.<br /><b>B:</b> It went by pretty fast.<br /><b>A:</b> But work goes on forever!<br /><b>B:</b> We have to work for 30 years!
<b>A:</b> Boy, I'm glad that job is finished.<br /><b>B:</b> How long did it take?<br /><b>A:</b> Four hours, without a break.<br /><b>B:</b> It's always nice to finish a job.<br /><b>A:</b> Well, it's good and bad.<br /><b>B:</b> What's bad about it?<br /><b>A:</b> When you finish, all you do is start another job!<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, that's right. It does get boring.<br /><b>A:</b> Especially if it's the same work, over and over.<br /><b>B:</b> But that's what most people do.<br /><b>A:</b> Yes, I guess most of us are stuck in a routine.<br /><b>B:</b> I wonder if there is any job that you don't repeat over and over.
<b>A:</b> I think I did something real stupid.<br /><b>B:</b> What did you do?<br /><b>A:</b> I bought some stock.<br /><b>B:</b> Everybody buys stock.<br /><b>A:</b> I bought it on a hunch.<br /><b>B:</b> You didn't read about the company first?<br /><b>A:</b> I didn't have to. It's been in business for 60 years.<br /><b>B:</b> So what's the problem?<br /><b>A:</b> I used all my savings on this one company.<br /><b>B:</b> You put all your eggs into one basket.<br /><b>A:</b> If the company goes out of business, I'll have nothing.<br /><b>B:</b> Oh, you'll have something—you'll have a lesson you'll never forget!
<b>A:</b> I want to move to New York.<br /><b>B:</b> To the state or the city?<br /><b>A:</b> To the city, of course.<br /><b>B:</b> Why do you want to move there?<br /><b>A:</b> Because I want to make a lot of money.<br /><b>B:</b> There are a lot of poor people in New York.<br /><b>A:</b> There sure are—at least a million.<br /><b>B:</b> So how do you plan to become rich?<br /><b>A:</b> I will knock on the doors of all the corporations.<br /><b>B:</b> That won't make you rich. Nobody will talk to you.<br /><b>A:</b> I will keep knocking on doors.<br /><b>B:</b> All you will get is sore knuckles.
<b>A:</b> I want to be a mail carrier when I grow up.<br /><b>B:</b> Why?<br /><b>A:</b> Because you get to meet a lot of people.<br /><b>B:</b> You sure do.<br /><b>A:</b> And you get a lot of exercise every day.<br /><b>B:</b> That's the truth.<br /><b>A:</b> And you get to play with a lot of dogs.<br /><b>B:</b> Well, you're supposed to be working.<br /><b>A:</b> Yes, but I will always pet the friendly dogs.<br /><b>B:</b> What about the unfriendly dogs?<br /><b>A:</b> I think if you are friendly to dogs, they are friendly to you.<br /><b>B:</b> Dogs are like people—not all of them are friendly.
<b>A:</b> I missed the TV news last night. What was on?<br /><b>B:</b> Nothing that would pass as news.<br /><b>A:</b> What's the weather going to be like this weekend?<br /><b>B:</b> I don't know. Whenever the weather comes on, I switch channels.<br /><b>A:</b> What was the lead story on the news?<br /><b>B:</b> Some actress was in court for driving without a license.<br /><b>A:</b> What was the second story?<br /><b>B:</b> Some actor married a woman young enough to be his daughter.<br /><b>A:</b> What was the third story?<br /><b>B:</b> A bull chased a man in a supermarket.<br /><b>A:</b> Wasn't there anything about Octo-Mom?<br /><b>B:</b> Of course. She's going to hire a nanny for her eight infants.
<b>A:</b> I had a busy morning.<br /><b>B:</b> What did you do?<br /><b>A:</b> I watered all the plants.<br /><b>B:</b> You have a lot of plants.<br /><b>A:</b> Then I did my laundry.<br /><b>B:</b> That takes some time.<br /><b>A:</b> I took the dog for a walk.<br /><b>B:</b> I'll bet he enjoyed his walk.<br /><b>A:</b> I vacuumed the entire house.<br /><b>B:</b> That's a lot of work.<br /><b>A:</b> And then I made lunch.<br /><b>B:</b> I'll bet you were hungry!
<b>A:</b> People are funny.<br /><b>B:</b> They sure are.<br /><b>A:</b> Did you hear about the pilot?<br /><b>B:</b> The one that stole a small plane?<br /><b>A:</b> Yes, he stole a plane in Canada and flew into the U.S.<br /><b>B:</b> Did they catch him?<br /><b>A:</b> Yes. After two U.S. fighter jets followed him for an hour, he landed on a highway.<br /><b>B:</b> Did he crash?<br /><b>A:</b> No, he just landed the plane and walked to a restaurant.<br /><b>B:</b> Did the cops find out why he flew into the U.S.?<br /><b>A:</b> His life sucked. He was hoping a fighter jet would shoot him down.<br /><b>B:</b> Poor guy.
<b>A:</b> How smart are you?<br /><b>B:</b> I don't know. I think I'm average.<br /><b>A:</b> Did you ever take an IQ test?<br /><b>B:</b> No, I never did. All I know is that I got A's and B's in school.<br /><b>A:</b> I wish I was really smart.<br /><b>B:</b> Don't be ridiculous.<br /><b>A:</b> What do you mean?<br /><b>B:</b> If you're going to make a wish, wish that you were really rich or famous.<br /><b>A:</b> Don't you ever wonder what it's like to be super-smart?<br /><b>B:</b> It must be very lonely.<br /><b>A:</b> Why's that?<br /><b>B:</b> Because if you're super-smart, no one understands what you're saying.
<b>A:</b> My pants have a hole in the front pocket.<br /><b>B:</b> You shouldn't carry pens in your pocket.<br /><b>A:</b> Yesterday a pen fell through my pants onto my shoe.<br /><b>B:</b> Lucky for you it wasn't a sharp knife.<br /><b>A:</b> Who carries a sharp knife in their pocket?<br /><b>B:</b> Criminals, of course.<br /><b>A:</b> Anyway, I have to fix the hole.<br /><b>B:</b> You can sew it up or use an iron-on patch.<br /><b>A:</b> Tell me about this patch.<br /><b>B:</b> The patch has glue. The hot iron melts the glue so the patch sticks on.<br /><b>A:</b> That sounds a lot easier than sewing.<br /><b>B:</b> It is. But after about ten washings, the glue washes off.
<b>A:</b> I don't like our flag.<br /><b>B:</b> What's the matter with it?<br /><b>A:</b> It's too much like other flags.<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, a lot of flags have stripes.<br /><b>A:</b> A flag should be pretty.<br /><b>B:</b> What should our flag look like?<br /><b>A:</b> It should have a pretty woman on it.<br /><b>B:</b> That's ridiculous!<br /><b>A:</b> You don't like pretty women?<br /><b>B:</b> Of course I do. But not on our flag!<br /><b>A:</b> Every nation should have a pretty woman on their flag.<br /><b>B:</b> You can't go to war carrying a flag with a woman on it!
<b>A:</b> What are you getting for your mom?<br /><b>B:</b> What are you talking about?<br /><b>A:</b> Sunday is Mother's Day.<br /><b>B:</b> This Sunday?<br /><b>A:</b> Of course. It's all over the news.<br /><b>B:</b> I thought it was next Sunday.<br /><b>A:</b> Well, you'd better get her something.<br /><b>B:</b> I'll get her a nice card.<br /><b>A:</b> Is that it?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes. That's all I ever give her.<br /><b>A:</b> She raised you, and all you ever give her is a card?<br /><b>B:</b> It's okay. She knows that I love her.
<b>A:</b> Do you know what today is?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, it's April 22.<br /><b>A:</b> It's more than just a date.<br /><b>B:</b> Is it your birthday or anniversary?<br /><b>A:</b> No, it's Earth Day.<br /><b>B:</b> What's that?<br /><b>A:</b> It's a yearly reminder to take care of our planet.<br /><b>B:</b> Oh, you mean like reuse things and recycle stuff?<br /><b>A:</b> Yes. We need to think green, save water, and stop using plastic bags.<br /><b>B:</b> How about if I take shorter showers?<br /><b>A:</b> That's a good idea, because showers waste a lot of water.<br /><b>B:</b> From now on I'll spend only 20 minutes in the shower.
<b>A:</b> Are you ready?<br /><b>B:</b> Ready for what?<br /><b>A:</b> Ready for the big switch.<br /><b>B:</b> What are you talking about?<br /><b>A:</b> The nation is switching to digital TV.<br /><b>B:</b> Oh. Of course I'm ready.<br /><b>A:</b> Did you buy the converter?<br /><b>B:</b> No, I don't need a converter because I bought a digital TV.<br /><b>A:</b> How much was that?<br /><b>B:</b> It was only about $120 for a 13-inch screen.<br /><b>A:</b> Does it pick up any digital channels?<br /><b>B:</b> Oh, yes. I get six Korean channels but nothing in English!
<b>A:</b> I'll be glad when winter comes.<br /><b>B:</b> Why is that?<br /><b>A:</b> Because I love the snow.<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, the snow is fun.<br /><b>A:</b> Last year we made a big snowman.<br /><b>B:</b> How big was it?<br /><b>A:</b> It was seven feet tall.<br /><b>B:</b> How long did it take?<br /><b>A:</b> It took us all day.<br /><b>B:</b> Did you give him a nose?<br /><b>A:</b> Of course. We gave him a big carrot for a nose.<br /><b>B:</b> Let me help you make one this year.
<b>A:</b> I don't get art.<br /><b>B:</b> Or artists.<br /><b>A:</b> They're in a different world.<br /><b>B:</b> I saw a painting of a jar that was full of pencils.<br /><b>A:</b> The artist said the jar was both full and empty.<br /><b>B:</b> But it was full of pencils! How could he say it was empty?<br /><b>A:</b> Artists see things differently.<br /><b>B:</b> Did you ever see anything that Picasso painted?<br /><b>A:</b> Of course! He's world famous.<br /><b>B:</b> Did he ever take art lessons?<br /><b>A:</b> I can't believe it. I drew paintings like that in third grade.<br /><b>B:</b> Where are they? Maybe they are worth millions.
<b>A:</b> I don't have long distance service with my home phone.<br /><b>B:</b> So how do you make long distance calls?<br /><b>A:</b> I use a calling card.<br /><b>B:</b> Where do you get that?<br /><b>A:</b> I buy it at the dollar store.<br /><b>B:</b> How much is it?<br /><b>A:</b> It's one dollar for 100 minutes.<br /><b>B:</b> That's only a penny a minute!<br /><b>A:</b> It's a great price. But you have to dial a lot of numbers.<br /><b>B:</b> How many?<br /><b>A:</b> First you dial seven numbers, then ten numbers, then ten more numbers.<br /><b>B:</b> Yikes. I think I'll keep my long distance service.
<b>A:</b> Let's go to the animal shelter.<br /><b>B:</b> What do you want to do?<br /><b>A:</b> I want to get a puppy for my son.<br /><b>B:</b> That will make him so happy.<br /><b>A:</b> I'll get him one of those little dogs.<br /><b>B:</b> One that won't grow up too big.<br /><b>A:</b> And eat too much.<br /><b>B:</b> Do you know which one he would like?<br /><b>A:</b> Oh, yes, I took him there yesterday. He showed me one that he really liked.<br /><b>B:</b> I bet you had to drag him away.<br /><b>A:</b> He wanted to take it home yesterday.<br /><b>B:</b> I wonder what he'll name it.
<b>A:</b> Poetry sucks.<br /><b>B:</b> I don't know anyone who likes it.<br /><b>A:</b> Some of it is okay, I guess.<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, the poems that rhyme and are easy to remember.<br /><b>A:</b> Like "One, two, buckle my shoe."<br /><b>B:</b> But people still write poems.<br /><b>A:</b> No one makes any money at it.<br /><b>B:</b> Shakespeare was a poet.<br /><b>A:</b> Did he get rich from his poetry?<br /><b>B:</b> Probably not.<br /><b>A:</b> Poems are a little bit like songs.<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, but songs have music. Without music, songs would suck, too.
<b>A:</b> Beer is a powerful drug.<br /><b>B:</b> So are cigarettes.<br /><b>A:</b> Which would you prefer?<br /><b>B:</b> What do you mean?<br /><b>A:</b> When you die and go to heaven, they will offer you beer or cigarettes.<br /><b>B:</b> I could pick only one or the other?<br /><b>A:</b> Yes. Nothing's perfect, not even in heaven.<br /><b>B:</b> Boy, that's a tough one.<br /><b>A:</b> What's so tough about it? Of course, I would pick cigarettes.<br /><b>B:</b> But cigarettes taste much better when you have a cold beer.<br /><b>A:</b> Well, you can't have everything.<br /><b>B:</b> I don't think I want to go to your heaven.
<b>A:</b> I'm worried.<br /><b>B:</b> Worried about what?<br /><b>A:</b> I'm getting married.<br /><b>B:</b> You should be happy, not worried.<br /><b>A:</b> I am happy, but marriage is a lot of responsibility.<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, you have to take care of your wife.<br /><b>A:</b> And I have to take care of our children.<br /><b>B:</b> Are you going to start a family?<br /><b>A:</b> Yes. We want to have a little boy and a little girl.<br /><b>B:</b> That sounds wonderful.<br /><b>A:</b> Except we can't afford it!<br /><b>B:</b> No wonder you're worried.
<b>A:</b> What's the point?<br /><b>B:</b> The point of what?<br /><b>A:</b> Of living.<br /><b>B:</b> Who knows? You live, and then you die.<br /><b>A:</b> We must be here for some reason.<br /><b>B:</b> Maybe we're here to have fun.<br /><b>A:</b> Then why aren't I having fun?<br /><b>B:</b> Because you're thinking too much.<br /><b>A:</b> So I should stop thinking?<br /><b>B:</b> Stop thinking about what the point is.<br /><b>A:</b> Okay. I'll start thinking about having some fun.<br /><b>B:</b> Just be patient. Fun doesn't come along every five minutes.
<b>A:</b> I'm going to the bank.<br /><b>B:</b> What do you need to do?<br /><b>A:</b> I need to withdraw some money.<br /><b>B:</b> How are you going to do that?<br /><b>A:</b> I'll just use the ATM.<br /><b>B:</b> What's that?<br /><b>A:</b> It's the Automatic Teller Machine.<br /><b>B:</b> It gives you money?<br /><b>A:</b> I just insert my debit card into the machine.<br /><b>B:</b> And it gives you money?<br /><b>A:</b> Well, it gives me money, but it's my own money.<br /><b>B:</b> Oh. What good is that? I thought it gave you free money.
<b>A:</b> Did you put the blue bin out on the street?<br /><b>B:</b> Oh, no. I forgot.<br /><b>A:</b> Well, you'd better take it out front.<br /><b>B:</b> What time does the recycle truck come by?<br /><b>A:</b> It usually gets here at noon on Tuesday, which is tomorrow.<br /><b>B:</b> I'll just take it out to the street tomorrow morning.<br /><b>A:</b> Oh, no, you don't.<br /><b>B:</b> What do you mean?<br /><b>A:</b> Every morning you get up late and rush off to work late.<br /><b>B:</b> Do you think I'll forget to do it?<br /><b>A:</b> You'll remember to do it, but you won't have time to do it.<br /><b>B:</b> Okay, I'll take it out front right now.
<b>A:</b> Do you know any good jokes?<br /><b>B:</b> I can't remember jokes.<br /><b>A:</b> Neither can I.<br /><b>B:</b> They go in one ear and out the other.<br /><b>A:</b> Who makes up all these jokes?<br /><b>B:</b> Who knows? But there must be a hundred new ones every day.<br /><b>A:</b> Yes, just in English alone.<br /><b>B:</b> I wonder if every language has jokes.<br /><b>A:</b> Of course! People everywhere like good jokes.<br /><b>B:</b> What do you think people joke about the most?<br /><b>A:</b> I think most jokes are about women.<br /><b>B:</b> Oh, really? I think most jokes are about men!
<b>A:</b> Did you wipe your feet? <br /><b>B:</b> Yes, of course I wiped my feet.<br /><b>A:</b> Then why is there mud on the carpet?<br /><b>B:</b> I don't know. It's not my mud.<br /><b>A:</b> Well, someone brought it into the house.<br /><b>B:</b> Look at the bottom of my shoes—they're clean.<br /><b>A:</b> Of course they're clean. You left all the mud on the carpet.<br /><b>B:</b> Okay, I'll get the vacuum cleaner.<br /><b>A:</b> Don't vacuum it now.<br /><b>B:</b> Don't you want me to clean up the mud?<br /><b>A:</b> Wait till it dries. It will be easier to vacuum.<br /><b>B:</b> Next time I will be more careful.
<b>A:</b> What are you going to do about your death?<br /><b>B:</b> Well, mostly I'll try to avoid it.<br /><b>A:</b> I mean, are you going to get buried or cremated?<br /><b>B:</b> My wife and I will be cremated.<br /><b>A:</b> Are you going to be buried next to each other?<br /><b>B:</b> Oh, no. Our ashes will be shaken into the ocean.<br /><b>A:</b> You're not going to be buried?<br /><b>B:</b> A coffin costs too much and takes up too much space.<br /><b>A:</b> Yes, but it will be in a cemetery where your children can visit you.<br /><b>B:</b> Children seldom visit their parents in a cemetery.<br /><b>A:</b> That's true. A cemetery is for dead people, not living people.<br /><b>B:</b> We figure our kids can visit us whenever they go to the beach.
<b>A:</b> What's the weather like?<br /><b>B:</b> I don't know. I just woke up.<br /><b>A:</b> Why don't you look outside?<br /><b>B:</b> Okay. It looks like rain.<br /><b>A:</b> Why do you say that?<br /><b>B:</b> The sky is gray.<br /><b>A:</b> Is it raining right now?<br /><b>B:</b> No.<br /><b>A:</b> How do you know?<br /><b>B:</b> The street isn't wet.<br /><b>A:</b> I have to go shopping today.<br /><b>B:</b> You'd better take an umbrella.
<b>A:</b> Don't wipe your nose on your sleeve.<br /><b>B:</b> But I don't have a tissue.<br /><b>A:</b> Then go find a tissue in the bathroom.<br /><b>B:</b> I didn't have time to get one from there.<br /><b>A:</b> Your sleeves are not tissues.<br /><b>B:</b> But Mom, all my friends use their sleeves.<br /><b>A:</b> That doesn't make it right.<br /><b>B:</b> I saw Dad wipe his nose on his sleeve yesterday.<br /><b>A:</b> I will talk to your father about that.<br /><b>B:</b> I bet Dad did it all the time when he was my age.<br /><b>A:</b> Your daddy was a good little boy.<br /><b>B:</b> How do you know? Were you his mommy, too?
<b>A:</b> You're very lucky.<br /><b>B:</b> Why do you say that?<br /><b>A:</b> You speak two languages.<br /><b>B:</b> Well, my English isn't perfect.<br /><b>A:</b> No one speaks perfect English.<br /><b>B:</b> Maybe I will be the first!<br /><b>A:</b> I've been thinking about learning Spanish.<br /><b>B:</b> Spanish is easy. I'll be happy to teach you.<br /><b>A:</b> How long will it take me to learn?<br /><b>B:</b> I think it will only take you a year or two.<br /><b>A:</b> How soon can we begin?<br /><b>B:</b> Ahora! That means right now.
<b>A:</b> I can't believe how hot it is.<br /><b>B:</b> It's not even noon yet.<br /><b>A:</b> That means it will get hotter.<br /><b>B:</b> I am dying from the heat.<br /><b>A:</b> Turn on the air conditioner.<br /><b>B:</b> It doesn't work.<br /><b>A:</b> What happened?<br /><b>B:</b> I don't know.<br /><b>A:</b> Did you call the repairman?<br /><b>B:</b> Of course.<br /><b>A:</b> When is he coming?<br /><b>B:</b> He's busy. He said next week.
<b>A:</b> The police need our help finding a robber.<br /><b>B:</b> How do you know?<br /><b>A:</b> The TV news is reporting a bank robbery.<br /><b>B:</b> Do they know what the robber looks like?<br /><b>A:</b> Yes, he's 6 feet tall, 200 pounds, black hair, and about 30 years old.<br /><b>B:</b> What race is he?<br /><b>A:</b> They didn't say.<br /><b>B:</b> The TV news doesn't tell us the race anymore.<br /><b>A:</b> Of course not. That would be racist.<br /><b>B:</b> But how can we identify someone if we don't know their race?<br /><b>A:</b> Don't ask me.<br /><b>B:</b> Then they also shouldn't tell us if the robber is male or female, because that is sexist.
<b>A:</b> My car is dirty.<br /><b>B:</b> Why don't you wash it?<br /><b>A:</b> That's what I'm going to do.<br /><b>B:</b> Are you going to wash it yourself?<br /><b>A:</b> Of course. It's not a hard job.<br /><b>B:</b> I'll help you.<br /><b>A:</b> Okay, I'll get a bucket.<br /><b>B:</b> I'll rinse the car first.<br /><b>A:</b> Then we can scrub it with a wet sponge and soap.<br /><b>B:</b> After that, we can dry it with a towel.<br /><b>A:</b> Then it will look like new<br /><b>B:</b> And you save $10.
<b>A:</b> This is such a long light.<br /><b>B:</b> Look how many cars are waiting in line.<br /><b>A:</b> They need a left-turn arrow.<br /><b>B:</b> Only two cars can make a left turn every three or four minutes.<br /><b>A:</b> We'll be here forever.<br /><b>B:</b> Get out of this lane.<br /><b>A:</b> But we need to turn left.<br /><b>B:</b> Forget it. Go straight.<br /><b>A:</b> Then what?<br /><b>B:</b> Then we'll just make a U-turn.<br /><b>A:</b> And then we can turn right at the light.<br /><b>B:</b> Good idea. It will be so much quicker.
<b>A:</b> I have to go to the bathroom.<br /><b>B:</b> Why didn't you go before we left?<br /><b>A:</b> I did, but I have to go again.<br /><b>B:</b> Well, hold on a little longer.<br /><b>A:</b> I think I'm going to explode.<br /><b>B:</b> Just hold on.<br /><b>A:</b> Oh! Don't hit any more bumps!<br /><b>B:</b> We'll be at McDonald's in just a few minutes.<br /><b>A:</b> I hope they are fast minutes.<br /><b>B:</b> Think about something else. Think about a hamburger.<br /><b>A:</b> I'm thinking, but I still have to go.<br /><b>B:</b> It's the next exit. Hold on!
<b>A:</b> Let's go for a ride.<br /><b>B:</b> Where are we going?<br /><b>A:</b> Into the mountains.<br /><b>B:</b> That sounds nice.<br /><b>A:</b> I want to show you my new car.<br /><b>B:</b> You bought a new car?<br /><b>A:</b> Yes. I bought a Cadillac.<br /><b>B:</b> A luxury car.<br /><b>A:</b> Luxury plus speed.<br /><b>B:</b> What are we waiting for?<br /><b>A:</b> Let me get the keys.<br /><b>B:</b> Let me get my camera.
<b>A:</b> I don't like riding the bus.<br /><b>B:</b> Why not?<br /><b>A:</b> Number one, it's too slow.<br /><b>B:</b> You're right. A car is faster.<br /><b>A:</b> Number two, it's usually late.<br /><b>B:</b> You're right. The buses are never on time.<br /><b>A:</b> Number three, it doesn't run 24 hours.<br /><b>B:</b> You're right. Buses don't run late at night.<br /><b>A:</b> Number four, it's too crowded.<br /><b>B:</b> You're right. You have to stand in the aisle.<br /><b>A:</b> Number five, it's unsafe.<br /><b>B:</b> You're right. Bad guys might rob you.
<b>A:</b> It sure is windy today.<br /><b>B:</b> Paper is flying everywhere.<br /><b>A:</b> This wind is dangerous for drivers.<br /><b>B:</b> Especially for drivers of big trucks.<br /><b>A:</b> The wind blows those trucks over.<br /><b>B:</b> It blows trees over, too.<br /><b>A:</b> A tree fell onto my dad's car.<br /><b>B:</b> Was there much damage?<br /><b>A:</b> My dad had to buy a new car.<br /><b>B:</b> Wow! That's terrible.<br /><b>A:</b> Never park your car under a tree.<br /><b>B:</b> The wind will get you, or the birds will get you.
<b>A:</b> They were in a crosswalk near school at 3 a.m.<br /><b>B:</b> Who?<br /><b>A:</b> Two students from USC.<br /><b>B:</b> What happened?<br /><b>A:</b> A speeding car ran a red light, killing the girl.<br /><b>B:</b> What happened to the other student?<br /><b>A:</b> He landed on the hood of the car.<br /><b>B:</b> Did he get off the hood?<br /><b>A:</b> No, the car stopped and the passenger pushed the injured student off the hood.<br /><b>B:</b> I'll bet the car continued on its way.<br /><b>A:</b> Of course it did. Why stop after you've run over two people?<br /><b>B:</b> I hope they find them and put them in jail for life.
<b>A:</b> When are we going to stop?<br /><b>B:</b> We'll stop at the next McDonald's.<br /><b>A:</b> How far away is that?<br /><b>B:</b> I think we'll be there in half an hour.<br /><b>A:</b> I hope so. I have to go to the bathroom.<br /><b>B:</b> Well, I can always pull over.<br /><b>A:</b> No, thank you, I'll just wait.<br /><b>B:</b> We can kill two birds with one stone.<br /><b>A:</b> What do you mean?<br /><b>B:</b> While you're using the bathroom, I'll order some food.<br /><b>A:</b> Don't order for me. I'm not hungry.<br /><b>B:</b> I'm very hungry. I'll order for you, and then I'll eat yours.
<b>A:</b> I don't like riding the bus.<br /><b>B:</b> Why not?<br /><b>A:</b> The seats and windows are dirty.<br /><b>B:</b> Don't they clean the bus every night?<br /><b>A:</b> I think they do.<br /><b>B:</b> You should bring some wipes with you.<br /><b>A:</b> That's a good idea.<br /><b>B:</b> Then you can wipe your seat and window.<br /><b>A:</b> People will think I'm strange.<br /><b>B:</b> Who cares? Everyone is strange.<br /><b>A:</b> That's for sure.<br /><b>B:</b> Don't worry about what people think.
<b>A:</b> I need a cheap car.<br /><b>B:</b> How much money do you have?<br /><b>A:</b> $1,000.<br /><b>B:</b> Well, that should get you something.<br /><b>A:</b> But I need something that's reliable.<br /><b>B:</b> You need a car with low mileage.<br /><b>A:</b> A car that was owned by a little old lady.<br /><b>B:</b> Where have you looked?<br /><b>A:</b> I haven't looked anywhere yet.<br /><b>B:</b> Why not?<br /><b>A:</b> Because I'll never find one for such a low price.<br /><b>B:</b> You're right about that. Keep saving your money.
<b>A:</b> Look at this traffic.<br /><b>B:</b> I'd rather not.<br /><b>A:</b> It gets worse every year.<br /><b>B:</b> Why are you complaining? We're going almost 20 miles an hour.<br /><b>A:</b> The speed limit is 65!<br /><b>B:</b> Well, that's between 2:00 and 4:00 a.m.<br /><b>A:</b> Where are all these people going?<br /><b>B:</b> They're all asking the same question.<br /><b>A:</b> When are they going to fix this problem?<br /><b>B:</b> They said they need more money.<br /><b>A:</b> They always need more money.<br /><b>B:</b> It'll get worse before it gets better.
<b>A:</b> Remember to put air in your tires.<br /><b>B:</b> How often do I have to do that?<br /><b>A:</b> Once every two months.<br /><b>B:</b> That's a lot.<br /><b>A:</b> What do you mean?<br /><b>B:</b> That's six times a year!<br /><b>A:</b> Yes, and it takes about five minutes each time.<br /><b>B:</b> I'll try.<br /><b>A:</b> Check your tires or you'll get a flat.<br /><b>B:</b> Oh. That's not good.<br /><b>A:</b> No, it isn't. A flat costs you time and money.<br /><b>B:</b> And I don't have either.
<b>A:</b> You're driving too fast.<br /><b>B:</b> Why do you say that?<br /><b>A:</b> The speed limit is 65.<br /><b>B:</b> I know that.<br /><b>A:</b> But you're doing 75.<br /><b>B:</b> So is everyone else.<br /><b>A:</b> But a cop might stop you.<br /><b>B:</b> No, he won't. Some cars are doing 85.<br /><b>A:</b> So the cop will stop those cars?<br /><b>B:</b> Of course. He stops the fastest cars.<br /><b>A:</b> My friend got a ticket for doing 75.<br /><b>B:</b> Your friend was unlucky.
<b>A:</b> What happened to your car?<br /><b>B:</b> I got a dent in the parking lot.<br /><b>A:</b> How did you get it?<br /><b>B:</b> I don't know. Maybe it was from a shopping cart.<br /><b>A:</b> Those shopping carts are dangerous.<br /><b>B:</b> Especially the metal ones.<br /><b>A:</b> I don't park at a store that uses metal shopping carts.<br /><b>B:</b> That's a good idea, but there was a good sale at this store.<br /><b>A:</b> Did you save any money on the sale?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, I did. I saved about $50.<br /><b>A:</b> That's great.<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, except this dent will cost about $150.
<b>A:</b> Good afternoon, officer.<br /><b>B:</b> Your driver's license and registration, please.<br /><b>A:</b> Here you go.<br /><b>B:</b> Do you know why I pulled you over?<br /><b>A:</b> I have no idea. All of a sudden I heard your siren.<br /><b>B:</b> You rolled through that stop sign back there.<br /><b>A:</b> But I stopped!<br /><b>B:</b> No, you didn't. You slowed down, but you didn't come to a full stop.<br /><b>A:</b> Well, nobody else does, so why should I?<br /><b>B:</b> That's not the attitude of a good driver.<br /><b>A:</b> But I am a good driver. I've never had a ticket in my life.<br /><b>B:</b> Well, you've got one now. Here. Have a nice day.
<b>A:</b> Did you see that car?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, he went through the red light.<br /><b>A:</b> Can we call the police?<br /><b>B:</b> No, the police don't care.<br /><b>A:</b> Why not?<br /><b>B:</b> They have to see it happen.<br /><b>A:</b> They don't believe us?<br /><b>B:</b> No. They can only give a ticket if they see it happen.<br /><b>A:</b> So, what do we do?<br /><b>B:</b> We don't do anything.<br /><b>A:</b> Maybe we should honk the horn next time.<br /><b>B:</b> The driver will just honk back at us.

I can't believe it.<br /><b>B:</b> What are you talking about?<br /><b>A:</b> I got a ticket downtown for $140.<br /><b>B:</b> Were you speeding?<br /><b>A:</b> No, I was crossing the street.<br /><b>B:</b> Were you jaywalking?<br /><b>A:</b> No, I was in the crosswalk.<br /><b>B:</b> So why did you get a ticket?<br /><b>A:</b> The officer said the red hand was blinking.<br /><b>B:</b> Was it blinking when you entered the crosswalk?<br /><b>A:</b> No, the white WALK sign was blinking.<br /><b>B:</b> You should fight that ticket. I'll be your witness.
<b>A:</b> We had a problem at school.<br /><b>B:</b> What was the problem?<br /><b>A:</b> Someone cut the tires.<br /><b>B:</b> What tires?<br /><b>A:</b> The tires on the cars.<br /><b>B:</b> Where were the cars?<br /><b>A:</b> They were in the student parking lot.<br /><b>B:</b> How many tires were cut?<br /><b>A:</b> One or two tires were cut on each car.<br /><b>B:</b> How many cars?<br /><b>A:</b> Eleven cars.<br /><b>B:</b> That's terrible. I hope they catch the person.
<b>A:</b> Life isn't fair.<br /><b>B:</b> It sure isn't.<br /><b>A:</b> I got a ticket yesterday.<br /><b>B:</b> What for?<br /><b>A:</b> I was crossing the street.<br /><b>B:</b> Were you in a crosswalk?<br /><b>A:</b> Yes, but the red hand was blinking.<br /><b>B:</b> So? That's a ticket?<br /><b>A:</b> Yes, it's a $140 ticket.<br /><b>B:</b> That's not right!<br /><b>A:</b> When I started to cross the street, the white walk sign was blinking.<br /><b>B:</b> You need to walk faster.
<b>A:</b> You're driving too fast.<br /><b>B:</b> I'm in a hurry.<br /><b>A:</b> Don't ever be in a hurry.<br /><b>B:</b> It's not my fault. You didn't wake me up.<br /><b>A:</b> That's not my fault. You didn't tell me to wake you up.<br /><b>B:</b> Well, I meant to.<br /><b>A:</b> Don't ever be in a hurry when you're driving.<br /><b>B:</b> Why not?<br /><b>A:</b> Because you'll have an accident. Most accidents are because people are in a hurry.<br /><b>B:</b> How do you know that?<br /><b>A:</b> I read a lot.<br /><b>B:</b> I thought drunks caused most accidents.
<b>A:</b> Where's the car?<br /><b>B:</b> What do you mean?<br /><b>A:</b> The car isn't here.<br /><b>B:</b> Where did you park it?<br /><b>A:</b> I parked it right here.<br /><b>B:</b> Are you sure?<br /><b>A:</b> Yes.

<b>A:</b> My parents are divorced.<br /><b>B:</b> So are mine.<br /><b>A:</b> Why did your parents get divorced?<br /><b>B:</b> My father found a new girlfriend.<br /><b>A:</b> That's too bad.<br /><b>B:</b> My mother was hurt and angry.<br /><b>A:</b> She had good reason.

That's all I have to do?<br /><b>A:</b> Take me to a nice restaurant, not to McDonald's.<br /><b>B:</b> But a nice restaurant costs money.<br /><b>A:</b> Yes, and you have to make a reservation.<br /><b>B:</b> That's such a hassle.<br /><b>A:</b> I knew you didn't love me.<br /><b>B:</b> Okay, okay! I'll make a reservation right now.

<b>A:</b> Tiger is the greatest golfer in the world.<br /><b>B:</b> You can say that again.<br /><b>A:</b> But I’m worried about Tiger.<br /><b>B:</b> Why is that?<br /><b>A:</b> Because he likes to SCUBA dive.<br /><b>B:</b> What’s wrong with that?<br /><b>A:</b> It can be dangerous.<br /><b>B:</b> You mean he could drown.<br /><b>A:</b> He shouldn’t SCUBA dive until he retires.<br /><b>B:</b> But he dives to relax.<br /><b>A:</b> He might relax, but it makes me nervous.<br /><b>B:</b> If his wife doesn’t mind, you shouldn’t mind.

<b>A:</b> I hate shaving.<br /><b>B:</b> Me too.<br /><b>A:</b> I just cut myself again.<br /><b>B:</b> Did you use a new blade?<br /><b>A:</b> It doesn't matter.

Why not?<br /><b>A:</b> Because food and other stuff sticks in my beard.<br /><b>B:</b> Hmm. Here's an idea. Put cream on your face and have the cat lick it off.

I told her to spend it on herself.<br /><b>B:</b> That was very nice of you.<br /><b>A:</b> I found out that she gave it to her new boyfriend.<br /><b>B:</b> Why did she do that?<br /><b>A:</b> He said he would buy her a nice ring.<br /><b>B:</b> What's wrong with that?<br /><b>A:</b> He went to Las Vegas. He lost it all gambling.<br /><b>B:</b> I hope your mom broke up with him.
<b>A:</b> Where are you going?<br /><b>B:</b> I have to walk the dog.<br /><b>A:</b> What kind of dog do you have?<br /><b>B:</b> I have a little poodle.<br /><b>A:</b> Poodles bark a lot.<br /><b>B:</b> They sure do.<br /><b>A:</b> They bark at everything.<br /><b>B:</b> They never shut up.<br /><b>A:</b> Why did you get a poodle?<br /><b>B:</b> It's my mom's dog.<br /><b>A:</b> So she likes poodles.<br /><b>B:</b> She says they're good watchdogs.

<b>A:</b> Mom, I want a puppy.<br /><b>B:</b> Let me think about it.<br /><b>A:</b> Why do you have to think about it?<br /><b>B:</b> Because a puppy costs money.<br /><b>A:</b> No, it doesn't. Puppies are free.<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, but a puppy needs shots.<br /><b>A:</b> Shots for what?<br /><b>B:</b> So it won't get sick. Just like you get shots.<br /><b>A:</b> I hate shots.<br /><b>B:</b> And a puppy eats food. Food costs money.<br /><b>A:</b> No problem.

You can even mail your ballot in.<br /><b>A:</b> All you have to do is vote and put a stamp on it.<br /><b>B:</b> How easy is that?<br /><b>A:</b> I guess people just don't care.<br /><b>B:</b> They'll care when they see their taxes go up.
<b>A:</b> Did you get your Official Sample Ballot?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, with the Voter Instructions.<br /><b>A:</b> How are you going to vote?<br /><b>B:</b> Same as ever, by mail. All it costs me is a 42-cent stamp.<br /><b>A:</b> I meant, are you going to vote for or against the new taxes?<br /><b>B:</b> Against all of them, of course.<br /><b>A:</b> But we need new taxes to pay for highways, schools, and prisons.<br /><b>B:</b> We've already voted for new taxes to pay for all that stuff!<br /><b>A:</b> That's true. Where did that money go?<br /><b>B:</b> Our legislators spent it on first-class travel all over the world.<br /><b>A:</b> They are having a good time with our money.<br /><b>B:</b> So when are we going to stop giving them more?
<b>A:</b> Who did you vote for for president?<br /><b>B:</b> I voted for Ralph Nader.<br /><b>A:</b> Who in the world is Ralph Nader?<br /><b>B:</b> He's the best man for president.<br /><b>A:</b> Why's that?<br /><b>B:</b> He hates corporations.<br /><b>A:</b> Well, most corporations do think only about money.<br /><b>B:</b> He hates Democrats and Republicans.<br /><b>A:</b> Well, they do put their party before their country.<br /><b>B:</b> He's the only candidate that I trust.<br /><b>A:</b> But he didn't have a chance.

<b>A:</b> That election for U.S. Senator stunk.<br /><b>B:</b> What do you mean?<br /><b>A:</b> There were more votes than voters!<br /><b>B:</b> But that's impossible.<br /><b>A:</b> Officials said that it's possible.<br /><b>B:</b> Did they explain how it's possible?<br /><b>A:</b> No. They said there are some things you can't explain.<br /><b>B:</b> So are they going to hold another election?<br /><b>A:</b> No. That will cost too much money.<br /><b>B:</b> So it's better to save money than to have an honest election?<br /><b>A:</b> Well, the Democratic Party says it was an honest election.<br /><b>B:</b> Of course they say that—their man won!
<b>A:</b> I don't know why I bother to vote.<br /><b>B:</b> Why's that?<br /><b>A:</b> What good does it do?<br /><b>B:</b> You get to put someone in power that you like.<br /><b>A:</b> Only if my candidate wins.<br /><b>B:</b> Well, he can't win unless you and others vote for him.<br /><b>A:</b> But even if my candidate wins, he'll break his promises.<br /><b>B:</b> That's true. They promise anything just so they get elected.<br /><b>A:</b> And when elected, they go their own way.<br /><b>B:</b> They forget who put them in power.<br /><b>A:</b> They forget where they came from.<br /><b>B:</b> Maybe you should run for office.

<b>A:</b> Have you decided how you are going to vote?<br /><b>B:</b> Do you mean on Measures 1, 2, and 3?<br /><b>A:</b> Yes. The ones that will improve our schools, roads, and hospitals.<br /><b>B:</b> You mean the measures that will raise our taxes.<br /><b>A:</b> But the TV ads say that our taxes will not increase.<br /><b>B:</b> Do you believe the TV ads?<br /><b>A:</b> I like the one where the fireman tells us why we should vote Yes.<br /><b>B:</b> Don't believe him! Whatever the TV ads tell you, the opposite is true.<br /><b>A:</b> But the title of Measure 1 is "Better Schools at No Cost."<br /><b>B:</b> The title should be "Better Schools at Huge Cost."<br /><b>A:</b> I can't believe that they would lie to us.<br /><b>B:</b> Of course they lie—that's what politicians do!

<b>A:</b> Did you read this article?<br /><b>B:</b> What article?<br /><b>A:</b> It says the mayor spends only 11 percent of his time on city duties.<br /><b>B:</b> Only 11 percent?<br /><b>A:</b> About 50 percent of the time he's traveling.<br /><b>B:</b> Where does he travel to?<br /><b>A:</b> Oh, all over the world.<br /><b>B:</b> But he's supposed to be making our city a better place.<br /><b>A:</b> He's visiting other cities to get ideas.<br /><b>B:</b> Can't he just go online?<br /><b>A:</b> The rest of the time he's raising money for his reelection.<br /><b>B:</b> Well, he'll never get reelected once this news gets out.
<b>A:</b> People say that everybody loves Obama.<br /><b>B:</b> Well, more than 50 million people voted for McCain.<br /><b>A:</b> That's 50 million people who don't love Obama.<br /><b>B:</b> Obama's got four years to make everyone happy.<br /><b>A:</b> He's never going to make everyone happy.<br /><b>B:</b> Can you imagine being President?<br /><b>A:</b> Everyone wants you to solve their problems.<br /><b>B:</b> I have enough stress from trying to solve my own problems.<br /><b>A:</b> You and everybody else.<br /><b>B:</b> I would never want to be President.<br /><b>A:</b> But think about all the power you'd have.<br /><b>B:</b> I prefer my quiet little life to all the power in the world.
<b>A:</b> Well, we have a new president.<br /><b>B:</b> But we have the same old problems.<br /><b>A:</b> Well, he's made a few changes.<br /><b>B:</b> Like what?<br /><b>A:</b> I think he closed the bowling alley in the White House.<br /><b>B:</b> Oh, yeah. He's changing it to a basketball court.<br /><b>A:</b> Who's paying for that?<br /><b>B:</b> I think we are!<br /><b>A:</b> Well, that's okay, as long as it helps him relax and think more clearly.<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, we need a relaxed president who thinks clearly.<br /><b>A:</b> Do any other world leaders have a basketball court?<br /><b>B:</b> They will. You know America always leads the way.

Do you live with your dad or mom?<br /><b>B:</b> I live with my dad.<br /><b>A:</b> Do you think that's why you don't get along with your mom?<br /><b>B:</b> I said I'm not comfortable talking about that.

Isn't that dangerous?<br /><b>A:</b> Don't be afraid. As long as we're careful, we'll be alright.<br /><b>B:</b> But I'm afraid of heights.<br /><b>A:</b> I'll be there. Like I said, we'll be okay.<br /><b>B:</b> Okay, I trust you.<br /><b>A:</b> A good roof is very important. If it leaks, it can ruin the interior.<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, I know.

You'll be ready to transfer in about two years.<br />
<b>A:</b> You want to go for a walk?<br /><b>B:</b> Sure! Where to?<br /><b>A:</b> I was thinking of going to the park.<br /><b>B:</b> Isn't it a bit far?<br /><b>A:</b> Not really. We'll just take our time. It's very beautiful there.<br /><b>B:</b> Okay, let's go.<br /><b>A:</b> Look at the swans. Do you see them?<br /><b>B:</b> They're gorgeous.

I do this walk often.<br /><b>B:</b> I didn't even think it was that far; it's so beautiful.<br />
<b>A:</b> Where do you want to go eat?<br /><b>B:</b> I'm not sure. Wait, watch out! The light is red!<br /><b>A:</b> Oh, damn. Well, there I passed it.<br /><b>B:</b> I think there was a cop at the light.<br /><b>A:</b> Can you check? Look behind you.<br /><b>B:</b> I don't see anything.

I've done a preliminary check of the property.<br /><b>B:</b> That's great!

I think I know what it is.<br /><b>A:</b> I hope you can understand.<br /><b>B:</b> I completely do. I'm so sorry. I didn't realize how loud my television was.<br /><b>A:</b> It's just a little too loud. If you could just lower it a tad bit.<br /><b>B:</b> This is so embarrassing for me. You have my sincerest apology.<br /><b>A:</b> No, that's alright. It happens to all of us at one point.<br /><b>B:</b> It's these new speakers that I bought. I'm just learning how to use them.<br /><b>A:</b> Please, say no more. Let's just put the matter to rest.<br /><b>B:</b> This won't happen again.<br />

It has something to do with how much I earned.<br /><b>B:</b> They pay benefits based on your income?<br /><b>A:</b> Yes. I think the more you earn, the more you receive.<br /><b>B:</b> That's interesting. I didn't know that.<br /><b>A:</b> I think I may go to the EDD office to ask about it.<br /><b>B:</b> You should go. What have you got to lose?<br />
<b>A:</b> What brings you in to see me today?<br /><b>B:</b> I'm here for my annual check-up.<br /><b>A:</b> Well, the nurse already took your blood pressure and she said it looks a little high.<br /><b>B:</b> That could be related to my thyroid medication.<br /><b>A:</b> That could be it. Let me listen to your heartbeat.<br /><b>B:</b> Does it sound good, doctor?<br /><b>A:</b> Sounds nice and strong to me.<br /><b>B:</b> I am concerned about some pain I've been having in my knee.<br /><b>A:</b> Are you very physically active?<br /><b>B:</b> I'm training to run the marathon.<br /><b>A:</b> That puts a lot of pressure on your knees.<br /><b>B:</b> I hope I don't have to stop training.<br />
<b>A:</b> Do you want to come with me to Walmart?<br /><b>B:</b> What do you need to buy?<br /><b>A:</b> I'm out of groceries.<br /><b>B:</b> Groceries are expensive at Walmart!<br /><b>A:</b> You really think so?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes!

<b>A:</b> I have an extra ticket to the Beyonce concert on Friday.<br /><b>B:</b> That's nice.<br /><b>A:</b> I was wondering if you want to come with me?<br /><b>B:</b> I really like Beyonce, but I'm busy on Friday.<br /><b>A:</b> Oh, I understand.

I've just liked you for a long time.<br /><b>B:</b> Again, that's sweet, but I'm not interested.<br />
<b>A:</b> I'm glad you came to talk to me today.<br /><b>B:</b> You kind of forced me to.<br /><b>A:</b> That's because I'm worried.<br /><b>B:</b> What are you worried about?<br /><b>A:</b> You withdrew from 4 of your 5 classes last semester.<br /><b>B:</b> I was doing poorly!<br /><b>A:</b> And why was that exactly?<br /><b>B:</b> It was just too hard.<br /><b>A:</b> You're really behind now. You might have to spend 6 years here.<br /><b>B:</b> Can't I just take summer classes?<br /><b>A:</b> Yes, but you don't want to stress yourself out.<br /><b>B:</b> I don't really have a choice.<br />

I've sent out about 50 resumes.<br /><b>B:</b> Did you include cover letters?<br /><b>A:</b> On some I did, others, no.<br /><b>B:</b> Well, that may be your problem. You should always include a cover letter.<br /><b>A:</b> Really? Why?<br /><b>B:</b> It shows you took the time to research the company. HR people like that.<br /><b>A:</b> Okay, I will. Thanks.<br /><b>B:</b> You're welcome. I think you will see more interest in your resume now.<br />

You date so many girls that I get confused.<br /><b>A:</b> First off, I don't date that many girls, and secondly you're always confused.<br /><b>B:</b> True. So, which one is she? Is she in your class?<br /><b>A:</b> Nope. She's the girl from the restaurant we go to in downtown.<br /><b>B:</b> From Green Bamboo? Which girl?<br /><b>A:</b> The cute one. You know the one with the tattoo up her thigh?<br /><b>B:</b> I think I would have noticed that.<br /><b>A:</b> She's the only one with blonde hair.<br /><b>B:</b> Well, why didn't you just say that? That's Sarah?<br /><b>A:</b> Well, I know you check her out. I assumed you saw the tattoo.<br /><b>B:</b> I'm not that big of a pervert.<br />

Music is a universal language.<br />

Something came up and I won't be home until 3 p.m.<br /><b>B:</b> That is not a problem, sir, I'll fix it.<br /><b>A:</b> Thank you. I was worried it had already been dispatched.<br /><b>B:</b> It's no problem at all.<br /><b>A:</b> Please tell the deliverymen to be aware of my dog.<br /><b>B:</b> Does he bite, sir?<br /><b>A:</b> No, but he may trip someone.<br /><b>B:</b> I'll make sure they're on high alert.<br />
<b>A:</b> This is it. We can move in starting tomorrow.<br /><b>B:</b> No way! Really?<br /><b>A:</b> Yup. We cleared escrow. It's officially ours now.<br /><b>B:</b> I don't know what to say.<br /><b>A:</b> It's time to figure out how we're going to move in.<br /><b>B:</b> Well, I think we should rent a trailer, and move the big stuff first.<br /><b>A:</b> Yeah, that would make sense.<br /><b>B:</b> I'll start boxing everything else.<br /><b>A:</b> I know of a good moving company. My best friend used them last year.<br /><b>B:</b> Are they affordable?<br /><b>A:</b> I think so. I'll call them tomorrow morning.<br /><b>B:</b> I still can't believe that house is ours. It's a great feeling.<br />
<b>A:</b> I can't pay for the ticket.<br /><b>B:</b> Why can't you pay for the ticket?<br /><b>A:</b> Well, I just got laid off from my job.<br /><b>B:</b> Okay, Mr. Richardson.

<b>A:</b> Do you know why I stopped you?<br /><b>B:</b> No, officer. Why?<br /><b>A:</b> You failed to stop at the stop sign.<br /><b>B:</b> I'm sorry, officer. I didn't see the stop sign.<br /><b>A:</b> Have you had anything to drink?<br /><b>B:</b> No, I have not. Do you need to see my license?<br /><b>A:</b> Yes, I need your license and registration.<br /><b>B:</b> Okay, here is my paperwork.<br /><b>A:</b> I will be back. I need to check your background.<br /><b>B:</b> Sure thing, officer.<br /><b>A:</b> Everything seems to be in order. I'm going to give you a warning.<br /><b>B:</b> Thank you, officer. I'll be more careful.<br />
<b>A:</b> Why are you taking this class?<br /><b>B:</b> I need it to transfer. You?<br /><b>A:</b> Me too! I would never take Speech 101 if I didn't need it.<br /><b>B:</b> Yeah, I hate public speaking.<br /><b>A:</b> Me too! I get so nervous.<br /><b>B:</b> I just want this class to be over with.<br /><b>A:</b> It's going to be a long semester.<br /><b>B:</b> Maybe after this class, we'll love public speaking.<br /><b>A:</b> I doubt it!<br /><b>B:</b> I don't even know why we have to take this class to transfer.<br /><b>A:</b> I guess it's to make us better speakers.<br /><b>B:</b> It'll all be worth it when we transfer.<br />
<b>A:</b> Excuse me. Can I have a minute of your time, please?<br /><b>B:</b> Sure, what is it?<br /><b>A:</b> I'm trying to take the bus to Downey, but I don't know where to take the bus.<br /><b>B:</b> Downey? Let me think. Are you visiting relatives there?<br /><b>A:</b> My girlfriend actually is the one I'm going to visit.<br /><b>B:</b> That's sweet. I'm sorry, small talk helps me remember.<br /><b>A:</b> In that case, let me ask where are you going?<br /><b>B:</b> I'm going to work. I take the bus there every day.<br /><b>A:</b> You must save plenty of money on gas and insurance.<br /><b>B:</b> Yup, I sure do. Wait, now I remember which bus takes you to Downey!<br /><b>A:</b> Can you tell me where to take it?<br /><b>B:</b> Sure. You need to take it on Florence Avenue in the city of Bell.<br />
<b>A:</b> Can I get you something to drink?<br /><b>B:</b> No, thanks. I just finished a whole bottle of water.<br /><b>A:</b> You won't mind if I have something then?<br /><b>B:</b> Of course not.<br /><b>A:</b> Can I offer you some fruit or cheese?<br /><b>B:</b> I just had lunch before I came here.<br /><b>A:</b> I really hope you don't mind if I eat because I haven't had lunch.<br /><b>B:</b> Go right ahead and do what you normally do.<br /><b>A:</b> I didn't eat because I assumed you would be joining me.<br /><b>B:</b> I hope you're not offended.<br /><b>A:</b> No, I'm not offended at all.<br /><b>B:</b> Oh, good. I ate before because I didn't want to impose.<br />
<b>A:</b> I have a few questions regarding the neighborhood.<br /><b>B:</b> Alright, let's hear them.<br /><b>A:</b> Does the neighborhood look good aesthetically?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, very much so.<br /><b>A:</b> That's good news. Can you describe how?<br /><b>B:</b> The neighborhood is abundant with plant life.<br /><b>A:</b> You mean like trees and bushes?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, and not just any regular trees and bushes. The ones here are beautiful.<br /><b>A:</b> Anything else you can describe?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes. The streets are nicely paved, and the street lights are quite quaint.<br /><b>A:</b> Wow, I could just picture it now.<br /><b>B:</b> The neighborhood will look even better in person.<br />
<b>A:</b> I am so excited. I've got my first job interview.<br /><b>B:</b> Interview for what?<br /><b>A:</b> It's an engineering internship for the city of L.A.<br /><b>B:</b> Wow, that's impressive.<br /><b>A:</b> I'm preparing for the interview by practicing with my sister.<br /><b>B:</b> What exactly are you doing?<br /><b>A:</b> We're doing mock interviews.<br /><b>B:</b> Is that helpful?<br /><b>A:</b> It sure is. She recorded our first interview, and pointed out things I should avoid.<br /><b>B:</b> What are some of the things she saw?<br /><b>A:</b> She said that I said,"You know" too much, and that I looked nervous.<br /><b>B:</b> Cool! That should help.<br /><b>A:</b> It has. I feel so confident now.<br /><b>B:</b> Well, good luck, my friend.<br />
<b>A:</b> I can't pay for the ticket.<br /><b>B:</b> Why can't you pay for the ticket?<br /><b>A:</b> Well, I just got laid off from my job.<br /><b>B:</b> Okay, Mr. Richardson.

I greatly appreciate it.<br /><b>B:</b> You're welcome. I hope you don't plan on returning to this courtroom anytime soon.<br />
<b>A:</b> Are you okay? You look really sad.<br /><b>B:</b> I'm homesick. I feel so out of place here.<br /><b>A:</b> But this college is so awesome.<br /><b>B:</b> I know, but I really miss home.<br /><b>A:</b> How far do you live?<br /><b>B:</b> Far. Let's just say I need an airplane to get there.<br /><b>A:</b> It's almost winter break. Hang in there.<br /><b>B:</b> I don't think I can handle it anymore.<br /><b>A:</b> Try calling your friends and family from your hometown.<br /><b>B:</b> I don't want them to worry about me.<br /><b>A:</b> Just call them. Don't you want to stop feeling sad?<br /><b>B:</b> Okay, I'll call them now.<br />
<b>A:</b> I'm sorry, but today's bus tour has been canceled because of the weather.<br /><b>B:</b> Now what am I supposed to do?<br /><b>A:</b> The hotel's concierge will be happy to find you tickets to a local theater production.<br /><b>B:</b> I'm not really a theater person.<br /><b>A:</b> How about we get you reservations to one of the city's finest restaurants?<br /><b>B:</b> That sounds good.<br /><b>A:</b> What kind of food do you like?<br /><b>B:</b> I love seafood, especially lobster.<br /><b>A:</b> I'll book you a table at the Lobster Shack restaurant then.<br /><b>B:</b> Will the hotel provide transportation?<br /><b>A:</b> We can get you a cab.<br /><b>B:</b> I'd prefer a limo.<br />
<b>A:</b> Hello. I'm new to the apartments. I have a question.<br /><b>B:</b> Hello, and welcome. What do you need to know?<br /><b>A:</b> Is there anything about parking my car that I need to know?<br /><b>B:</b> You have an assigned parking spot behind the building.<br /><b>A:</b> Are there other parking spots available?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes. We have several unassigned spots for visitors.<br /><b>A:</b> Where are those visitor parking spots located?<br /><b>B:</b> Behind the building as well.<br /><b>A:</b> What if all parking spots are filled up?<br /><b>B:</b> You could park in the streets, but you might be ticketed if you fail to follow rules.<br /><b>A:</b> Could you show me how to enter the parking area?<br /><b>B:</b> Yeah, I'll show you. Follow me.<br />

<b>A:</b> Everything is going wrong today.<br /><b>B:</b> Well, at least the weather is nice.<br /><b>A:</b> Oh, yeah. Imagine if it had rained like they said it would.<br /><b>B:</b> I know, I would have gotten soaked walking home.<br /><b>A:</b> Yeah, I love when the sun is shining, but it's not too hot.<br /><b>B:</b> I do, too. This weather is pretty sweet.<br /><b>A:</b> I guess everything will be okay in the end.<br /><b>B:</b> So all you needed was some sunshine.<br /><b>A:</b> Yeah, I guess you were right – for once.<br /><b>B:</b> Hey! I'm always right.<br />
<b>A:</b> I need to get to the airport by 6 o'clock.<br /><b>B:</b> That's in less than 45 minutes. You'll never make it.<br /><b>A:</b> I have to try. I was hoping to get the shuttle home.<br /><b>B:</b> Why did you wait so long?<br /><b>A:</b> It was my boss. He kept us late.<br /><b>B:</b> Well, there goes a taxi.<br /><b>A:</b> Taxi! Taxi! Darn, someone else got it.<br /><b>B:</b> You're going to have a hard time getting a taxi at this hour.<br /><b>A:</b> I know, but what can I do? Taxi!<br /><b>B:</b> Well, good luck, George. I'm taking the subway.<br /><b>A:</b> Okay, have a good weekend. Taxi!<br />
<b>A:</b> Quick! Get in here and wait out the storm!<br /><b>B:</b> Oh, my word. Thank you so much.<br /><b>A:</b> It's raining cats and dogs out there.<br /><b>B:</b> More like lions and wolves!<br /><b>A:</b> I was watching the news.<br /><b>B:</b> What did they say?<br /><b>A:</b> This is going to be one heck of a storm.<br /><b>B:</b> Should we be worried?<br /><b>A:</b> I don't think so. The emergency alert system would have gone up.<br /><b>B:</b> True. Well, thank you for saving me from this storm.<br /><b>A:</b> No problem. I'm making some tea; would you like some?<br /><b>B:</b> Please. Something warm would be great at the moment!<br />
<b>A:</b> I can't find the jasmine rice!<br /><b>B:</b> Isn't it in the rice section?<br /><b>A:</b> No, they don't have it here.<br /><b>B:</b> Let's check again. Is it this one?<br /><b>A:</b> No, that's short grain white rice.<br /><b>B:</b> What about this one? It's longer.<br /><b>A:</b> No, that's brown rice.<br /><b>B:</b> How are we supposed to find jasmine rice?<br /><b>A:</b> Oh, I see more rice in another isle.<br /><b>B:</b> I found it in the international section.<br /><b>A:</b> I find it funny that Americans think this rice is exotic!<br /><b>B:</b> Me, too! But Americans call everything different exotic.<br />
<b>A:</b> You sure are buying a lot of snacks.<br /><b>B:</b> That's because I'm going on a long car trip.<br /><b>A:</b> Where are you driving to?<br /><b>B:</b> I'm driving to Comic-Con in San Diego this weekend.<br /><b>A:</b> You're driving all the way there to read comic books?<br /><b>B:</b> No. I will be meeting comic artists and voice actors.<br /><b>A:</b> That sounds really impressive!<br /><b>B:</b> If I'm lucky, I'll even meet Stan Lee!<br /><b>A:</b> Is he as famous as Bruce Lee?<br /><b>B:</b> Stan Lee is a famous comic book writer and creator.<br /><b>A:</b> I think I'd be more impressed to meet Bruce Lee.<br /><b>B:</b> Bruce Lee wouldn't stand a chance against Stan's heroes!<br />
<b>A:</b> Did you water the plants?<br /><b>B:</b> I did this morning.<br /><b>A:</b> It doesn't look like you did.<br /><b>B:</b> Well, I did. Are you calling me a liar?<br /><b>A:</b> No. It's just I know sometimes you can be a little lazy.<br /><b>B:</b> Is this how you normally speak to people you are in a relationship with?<br /><b>A:</b> This is how I speak to people who are not doing what they are supposed to do.<br /><b>B:</b> Wow! I am really hurt by how you are talking to me.<br /><b>A:</b> Maybe you are feeling guilty.<br /><b>B:</b> No. I'm feeling like I made a mistake.<br /><b>A:</b> What do you mean?<br /><b>B:</b> I'm going to go for a walk before I say something I'm going to regret.<br />
<b>A:</b> Hello, this is Isabel Foster.<br /><b>B:</b> Hi, Isabel. Why are you calling?

<b>A:</b> Excuse me, sir. How much for this lamp?<br /><b>B:</b> I'll sell it to you for $50.<br /><b>A:</b> Oh, no! That's way too expensive.<br /><b>B:</b> What price did you have in mind?<br /><b>A:</b> Maybe something closer to one fourth that much.<br /><b>B:</b> I might as well give it away for that price!<br /><b>A:</b> What about half?<br /><b>B:</b> That's still not enough of a profit.<br /><b>A:</b> I'll give you $30 for it.<br /><b>B:</b> Make it $35 and you've got a deal.<br /><b>A:</b> Alright, that sounds good to me.<br /><b>B:</b> You sure drive a hard bargain!<br />
<b>A:</b> You need to try harder in school!<br /><b>B:</b> I am doing well in school.<br /><b>A:</b> Then why are your marks in science so low?<br /><b>B:</b> I don't understand science, that's all.<br /><b>A:</b> Is that the same reasoning you have for math?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, and English, too.<br /><b>A:</b> Tell me one single subject you're doing well in.<br /><b>B:</b> Well, I'm doing wonderfully in my music class.<br /><b>A:</b> What about history?<br /><b>B:</b> Only the parts about Woodstock.<br /><b>A:</b> That's it! You're grounded! No guitar for a month.<br /><b>B:</b> Great, now I'll surely have a low GPA.<br />
<b>A:</b> Do you know where I could dispose of my trash?<br /><b>B:</b> Yeah, there are two different colored trash cans in the back.<br /><b>A:</b> Is there a difference between the two?<br /><b>B:</b> Well, one is for recycling and the other is for trash.<br /><b>A:</b> Can you tell me which color is the one for recycling?<br /><b>B:</b> That would be the blue trash can.<br /><b>A:</b> And the black trash can is for regular trash?<br /><b>B:</b> That is correct.<br /><b>A:</b> On what day does the garbage truck come by to pick up the trash?<br /><b>B:</b> It comes every Thursday.<br /><b>A:</b> Thank you for your help. Take care.<br /><b>B:</b> Sure. Don't mention it.<br />
<b>A:</b> You want to go for a walk?<br /><b>B:</b> Sure! Where to?<br /><b>A:</b> I was thinking of going to the park.<br /><b>B:</b> Isn't it a bit far?<br /><b>A:</b> Not really. We'll just take our time. It's very beautiful there.<br /><b>B:</b> Okay, let's go.<br /><b>A:</b> Look at the swans. Do you see them?<br /><b>B:</b> They're gorgeous. Look at how white those plumes are.<br /><b>A:</b> And the lake looks so calm.<br /><b>B:</b> It does. This was a great idea.<br /><b>A:</b> I know. I do this walk often.<br /><b>B:</b> I didn't even think it was that far; it's so beautiful.<br />
<b>A:</b> Have you ever been to the opera before?<br /><b>B:</b> No, but I hear it's very beautiful.<br /><b>A:</b> Is it true that opera is sung in a foreign language?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, usually in Italian or French.<br /><b>A:</b> How are we supposed to know what's going on?<br /><b>B:</b> The actors also tell the story with their actions.<br /><b>A:</b> It seems a bit confusing to me.<br /><b>B:</b> The music is supposed to be beautiful, regardless.<br /><b>A:</b> Are they accompanied by an orchestra?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, a very large one with talented performers.<br /><b>A:</b> I suppose the music will tell a story, too.<br /><b>B:</b> Yes. Music is a universal language.<br />
<b>A:</b> I cut myself pretty badly with a knife. I think I need stitches.<br /><b>B:</b> Come inside so the triage nurse can stop the bleeding.<br /><b>A:</b> I was just preparing dinner and my hand slipped.<br /><b>B:</b> This cut does need stitches, but I stopped the bleeding for now.<br /><b>A:</b> Will you give me stitches right now?<br /><b>B:</b> No, since the bleeding has stopped you have to wait in the Emergency Room waiting area.<br /><b>A:</b> What do I do while waiting?<br /><b>B:</b> Fill out these registration forms.<br /><b>A:</b> When will I get my hand stitched up?<br /><b>B:</b> Here in the ER we take care of people based on how bad their injury is.<br /><b>A:</b> I was here before many of these other people.<br /><b>B:</b> Some of them are in worse shape than you.<br />

What is your emergency?<br /><b>B:</b> I think my wife just had a stroke or a heart attack.<br /><b>A:</b> Can you describe her symptoms?<br /><b>B:</b> She is unconscious but breathing. She won't wake up.<br /><b>A:</b> We are sending an ambulance right now.<br /><b>B:</b> How do you know my address?<br /><b>A:</b> We can track it down through our phone system.<br /><b>B:</b> How long will it take for the ambulance to get here?<br /><b>A:</b> It should be there in less than five minutes, sir.<br /><b>B:</b> I think I hear the ambulance coming now.<br /><b>A:</b> Please let the paramedics in so they can take your wife to the nearest hospital.<br /><b>B:</b> Thank you. I'll open the door.<br />
<b>A:</b> Why are you holding your mouth?<br /><b>B:</b> I think I cracked a tooth. It hurts so much.<br /><b>A:</b> Did you look in the mirror?<br /><b>B:</b> No, but I can feel a sharp pain when my tongue touches my molars.<br /><b>A:</b> That sort of thing can be infected easily.<br /><b>B:</b> So what should I do?<br /><b>A:</b> You should find an emergency dentist.<br /><b>B:</b> That is going to cost so much money.<br /><b>A:</b> Yeah, but it's better than being in pain.<br /><b>B:</b> Do you think they'll have to pull the tooth?<br /><b>A:</b> Maybe they just have to seal it up.<br /><b>B:</b> Get me the yellow pages so I can find a nearby emergency dentist.<br />
<b>A:</b> That is such a cute dress!<br /><b>B:</b> Thanks! I bought it yesterday.<br /><b>A:</b> Have you worn it yet?<br /><b>B:</b> No, I have to accessorize it first!<br /><b>A:</b> Did you buy everything you needed?<br /><b>B:</b> Yep!

<b>A:</b> Hello. I need to make an appointment.<br /><b>B:</b> Were you mandated by the court to go to traffic school?<br /><b>A:</b> Yes, I was. Does that matter?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, it does. Let me have your full name.<br /><b>A:</b> It's David Johnson. What days do you have available?<br /><b>B:</b> We have Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday.<br /><b>A:</b> Oh, okay. I can make it on Thursday. What time should I be in?<br /><b>B:</b> Come in at 9 a.m. if you can't make it during that time, please call.<br /><b>A:</b> Great. I will see you this Thursday.<br /><b>B:</b> Remember to bring your court papers. We will need to sign those.<br /><b>A:</b> I seem to have lost them. Could I go to court to get another copy?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, go to the court and print them out before you come over.<br />
<b>A:</b> Thank you for coming in today. I'll see you next week.<br /><b>B:</b> Excuse me, instructor. May I speak with you for a moment?<br /><b>A:</b> Sure thing, Mr. Davis. What can I help you with?<br /><b>B:</b> Well, about next week. I can't make it.<br /><b>A:</b> That is a problem. You are mandated by court to attend every week.<br /><b>B:</b> I know, but I have a family emergency.<br /><b>A:</b> You have to go to the court and ask for an extension.<br /><b>B:</b> Do I have to come back over here after?<br /><b>A:</b> No, they will give you a make-up date.<br /><b>B:</b> Great. Thank you for all your help.<br /><b>A:</b> Sure thing. I hope everything is alright.<br /><b>B:</b> Thanks. I'll see you next time.<br />
<b>A:</b> I was hoping you could help me.<br /><b>B:</b> I'll try. What help do you need?<br /><b>A:</b> I'm having an interview tomorrow morning. I'm very nervous.<br /><b>B:</b> That's great! Why are you nervous though?<br /><b>A:</b> I don't do well in interviews.<br /><b>B:</b> They can be frightening, but you can do it.<br /><b>A:</b> I'm afraid they'll ask me something I won't know.<br /><b>B:</b> You should prepare yourself. Go online, and look at their website.<br /><b>A:</b> Now why didn't I think of that?<br /><b>B:</b> It's a good idea to know everything you can about them first.<br /><b>A:</b> That's an excellent idea! Thanks.<br /><b>B:</b> You're welcome. If you need more help, give me a call.<br />
<b>A:</b> I'm sorry for being difficult.<br /><b>B:</b> Not at all. We aim to please.<br /><b>A:</b> It's just that this will be my family's home. It has to be right.<br /><b>B:</b> I understand completely.<br /><b>A:</b> So where is this next home?<br /><b>B:</b> It's nearby. I think this is the one.<br /><b>A:</b> I truly hope so.<br /><b>B:</b> This is it.<br /><b>A:</b> Wow! I like it.<br /><b>B:</b> I thought you might.<br /><b>A:</b> Is this in my price range? If it is, I think I just found my house.<br /><b>B:</b> It definitely is. Let's go inside.<br />
<b>A:</b> I'd like to buy some flowers for my best friend's birthday.<br /><b>B:</b> What is your friend's favorite color?<br /><b>A:</b> She loves the color pink.<br /><b>B:</b> I can make her a bouquet with pink roses.<br /><b>A:</b> I don't want roses because that seems romantic, not to mention expensive.<br /><b>B:</b> I can make the bouquet with carnations, lilies, and daisies instead.<br /><b>A:</b> That sounds friendlier and cheaper.<br /><b>B:</b> Would you like these to be delivered to your friend?<br /><b>A:</b> That would be a great surprise.<br /><b>B:</b> Just fill out this card and include the delivery address.<br /><b>A:</b> Can you deliver these today?<br /><b>B:</b> I can have them to your friend before 5 p.m.<br />
<b>A:</b> So, how much is the ticket going to cost?<br /><b>B:</b> Well, it's going to be $200.<br /><b>A:</b> $200 for a parking ticket?<br /><b>B:</b> Well, it looks like this is your third parking ticket.<br /><b>A:</b> Yes, but I haven't gotten one in a couple of months.<br /><b>B:</b> This is your third parking ticket this year.<br /><b>A:</b> I know. Fine, I will pay the ticket.<br /><b>B:</b> How will you be paying the ticket?<br /><b>A:</b> I will be paying cash.<br /><b>B:</b> So that'll be $200 in cash.<br /><b>A:</b> Yes. Let me get you your receipt.<br /><b>B:</b> Thank you. Have a nice day.<br />
<b>A:</b> It's been so long since I've seen you!<br /><b>B:</b> I know. You haven't changed a bit.<br /><b>A:</b> Oh, stop lying. I've gained a little weight.<br /><b>B:</b> We all have gained some weight.<br /><b>A:</b> Tell me how the kids are doing.<br /><b>B:</b> They are doing well, and yours?<br /><b>A:</b> They are doing so well, growing up so fast.<br /><b>B:</b> Are you at the same job or are you doing something else?<br /><b>A:</b> No. I left that place three years ago to start my own business.<br /><b>B:</b> Congratulations! You always had an independent spirit.<br /><b>A:</b> Thanks. It's going really well so far.<br /><b>B:</b> I'd love to hear more about it over a cup of coffee.<br />

That's a lot!<br /><b>B:</b> I just want a lot of options.<br /><b>A:</b> But it costs a lot of money and time!<br /><b>B:</b> I get fee waivers.<br /><b>A:</b> But how about the time? I mean, applying is a lot of work.<br /><b>B:</b> College applications ask similar questions.<br /><b>A:</b> Good for you. I'm only applying to three universities.<br /><b>B:</b> Which ones are you applying to?<br /><b>A:</b> CSULA, UC Irvine, and Yale.<br /><b>B:</b> I find it hard to believe that you can limit yourself to only three universities.<br />
<b>A:</b> What are some of the best things to see in this city?<br /><b>B:</b> If you want to go sightseeing, we have a tour that leaves from the hotel.<br /><b>A:</b> I'd rather explore the city on my own.<br /><b>B:</b> In that case I can give you a map that highlights some of the best things to see.<br /><b>A:</b> That sounds perfect.<br /><b>B:</b> The map also has coupons attached for some restaurants and shops near the landmarks.<br /><b>A:</b> I love a bargain.<br /><b>B:</b> You can walk around the city, but I'll also give you a subway map in case you want to take the train.<br /><b>A:</b> The subway looks scary in the movies and on TV.<br /><b>B:</b> It isn't scary at all.<br /><b>A:</b> Can I get a subway pass from you?<br /><b>B:</b> No, you'll have to buy that at the train station.<br />
<b>A:</b> Check out my birthday haul!<br /><b>B:</b> Wow, that's a lot of cash!<br /><b>A:</b> My relatives were really generous.<br /><b>B:</b> What are you gonna buy with it?<br /><b>A:</b> Well, I'm going to save half of it.<br /><b>B:</b> What?! You could buy so much with this!<br /><b>A:</b> I know, but I want to save some for later.<br /><b>B:</b> Well, maybe you can still afford that new video game.<br /><b>A:</b> No way! I'm going to stretch this money.<br /><b>B:</b> How are you going to do that?<br /><b>A:</b> I'm going to buy used games instead.<br /><b>B:</b> Well, I guess a used game is better than nothing.<br />
<b>A:</b> I'm checking out, but is there a place I can store my luggage for a few hours?<br /><b>B:</b> Why do you need us to hold your luggage, sir?<br /><b>A:</b> My flight doesn't leave for another four hours.<br /><b>B:</b> We can hold your luggage, but there is an additional cost associated with that service.<br /><b>A:</b> How much is it going to cost me?<br /><b>B:</b> It will be $6 an hour.<br /><b>A:</b> I'm going to drink at your hotel bar. Can you hook me up?<br /><b>B:</b> Unfortunately, sir, we cannot. Shall I take your credit card?<br /><b>A:</b> No, forget it. It's cheaper for me to use a locker at the airport.<br /><b>B:</b> Those airport lockers are not always safe though.<br /><b>A:</b> I'll take my chances.<br /><b>B:</b> Good luck with that, sir.<br />
<b>A:</b> Hello, neighbor. How are you today?<br /><b>B:</b> I'm fine. How are you?<br /><b>A:</b> I'm doing alright. I was wondering if I could ask you for a favor.<br /><b>B:</b> Sure. What is it?<br /><b>A:</b> I'll be away for the weekend. Could you take care of my dog?<br /><b>B:</b> Yeah, I'd love to. I'm great with dogs.<br /><b>A:</b> Oh, that's fantastic! Thank you very much!<br /><b>B:</b> Is there anything I need to know about your dog?<br /><b>A:</b> Not really. She's an old, calm, and friendly dog. You'll have no trouble.<br /><b>B:</b> Alright. I'll give you a call if I have any questions or concerns.<br /><b>A:</b> I'll bring her over in a few minutes along with her food. Thanks again!<br /><b>B:</b> No problem. Have a safe trip.<br />
<b>A:</b> This is Joseph Walters, the inspector.<br /><b>B:</b> Hello, Joseph. I'm the buyer, Mrs. Smith<br /><b>A:</b> Hello, Mrs. Smith. I've done a preliminary check of the property.<br /><b>B:</b> That's great! What did you find?<br /><b>A:</b> There are some issues with this home.<br /><b>B:</b> For instance?<br /><b>A:</b> Structurally, the house is sound.<br /><b>B:</b> That's a good start, Joseph.<br /><b>A:</b> The plumbing is substandard, the water heater is old, and the roof has issues.<br /><b>B:</b> You're kidding, right?<br /><b>A:</b> I wish I was. I'll know more in a couple of days.<br /><b>B:</b> Okay, keep me informed.<br />
<b>A:</b> Hi! How are you?<br /><b>B:</b> I'm doing good. Hey, did you apply for the job?<br /><b>A:</b> I sure did. I'm meeting your boss today.<br /><b>B:</b> Today, but it's Saturday.<br /><b>A:</b> I know. I'm meeting with him at a restaurant later.<br /><b>B:</b> That's cool. He must be very interested.<br /><b>A:</b> Can you describe him?<br /><b>B:</b> Sure. He's a tall Asian, who is a bit overweight with long black hair.<br /><b>A:</b> Well, that helps. This is the first time I will see him.<br /><b>B:</b> He's really friendly, and he always wears a tie.<br /><b>A:</b> Okay, thanks. That helps.<br /><b>B:</b> No problem, my friend. Good luck on your interview.<br />
<b>A:</b> I have to go to bed early.<br /><b>B:</b> Why? The night is still young!<br /><b>A:</b> I have a class at 7 a.m.<br /><b>B:</b> That's tough! My earliest class is at 9 a.m.<br /><b>A:</b> That sounds amazing to me.<br /><b>B:</b> How do you stay awake in that class?<br /><b>A:</b> Before I go to class, I drink four cups of coffee and take a cold shower.<br /><b>B:</b> Interesting routine. Does it work?<br /><b>A:</b> Kind of. It's better than not doing it at all.<br /><b>B:</b> Why are you taking that class?<br /><b>A:</b> It's only offered once a year, so I have to take it now.<br /><b>B:</b> I hope the class is interesting, at least.<br />
<b>A:</b> Do you hate flying as much as I do?<br /><b>B:</b> Only when I have chatty seatmates.<br /><b>A:</b> You look like a business traveler, am I right?<br /><b>B:</b> I'm in sales, but please excuse me. I have a lot of work to do.<br /><b>A:</b> Is that computer connected to the airplane wi-fi network?<br /><b>B:</b> It is, so I can send work to my office even when travelling.<br /><b>A:</b> I hope they pay you really well.<br /><b>B:</b> That's really none of your business.<br /><b>A:</b> Do you have a company credit card?<br /><b>B:</b> I do because I travel so much.<br /><b>A:</b> Maybe you can buy me a drink since all I have is cash.<br /><b>B:</b> I can only pay for business expenses, not alcohol.<br />
<b>A:</b> I'm starving!<br /><b>B:</b> Me too. Let's get something to eat.<br /><b>A:</b> What would you like?<br /><b>B:</b> I know! Let's go down to the Farmer's Market.<br /><b>A:</b> What do they sell to eat there?<br /><b>B:</b> Only the best produce in the city!<br /><b>A:</b> What makes it so great?<br /><b>B:</b> Well it's all organically grown.<br /><b>A:</b> Can't we just go to the supermarket?<br /><b>B:</b> No way! Those vegetables don't compare at all!<br /><b>A:</b> I don't feel like cooking. Let's get burgers.<br /><b>B:</b> Fine, let's get some burgers.<br />
<b>A:</b> What do you think I should get for dessert?<br /><b>B:</b> I don't know, look at the menu.<br /><b>A:</b> Wow! They have icecream, pies, cakes.<br /><b>B:</b> It looks like a great selection!<br /><b>A:</b> I don't know what to get!<br /><b>B:</b> It's kind of hot out. Maybe icecream would be good.<br /><b>A:</b> Icecream sounds fantastic!<br /><b>B:</b> How about we go to the icecream parlor down the street?<br /><b>A:</b> That sounds good to me! Let's go.<br /><b>B:</b> That pecan pie is calling my name, though.<br /><b>A:</b> Answer to icecream's call only!<br /><b>B:</b> You're right! Let's go!<br />
<b>A:</b> Let's book a trip to Puerto Rico.<br /><b>B:</b> There are so many online services that let us book from our computer right here at home.<br /><b>A:</b> How will we know we're getting a good deal though?<br /><b>B:</b> If we use a site like Expedia or Priceline, we can find something within our budget.<br /><b>A:</b> Can we book both flights and hotels online?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, and we can even rent a car as part of our package.<br /><b>A:</b> I just logged onto those websites, so now what?<br /><b>B:</b> Just put the dates you want to travel, where you're traveling from, and where you want to go.<br /><b>A:</b> Wow, there are even reviews from people who stayed at the hotels.<br /><b>B:</b> Yes. You can even see pictures of what the hotel rooms look like.<br /><b>A:</b> We don't get paper tickets though.<br /><b>B:</b> We can print out all the information after we book it online if you want.<br />
<b>A:</b> There really is no place like home even after a vacation.<br /><b>B:</b> Um honey, did you tell the neighbor to water the plants?<br /><b>A:</b> I thought you did.<br /><b>B:</b> What about the mail, did you tell the neighbor to pick that up?<br /><b>A:</b> So I have to do everything around here?<br /><b>B:</b> What about the cat?<br /><b>A:</b> What about the cat?<br /><b>B:</b> Did you get the neighbor to feed the cat while we were gone?<br /><b>A:</b> Cats are pretty good at taking care of themselves.<br /><b>B:</b> I can't believe you!<br /><b>A:</b> At least no one broke into the house while we were gone.<br /><b>B:</b> Thank goodness for the small miracle.<br />
<b>A:</b> What are some of the best things to see in this city?<br /><b>B:</b> If you want to go sightseeing, we have a tour that leaves from the hotel.<br /><b>A:</b> I'd rather explore the city on my own.<br /><b>B:</b> In that case I can give you a map that highlights some of the best things to see.<br /><b>A:</b> That sounds perfect.<br /><b>B:</b> The map also has coupons attached for some restaurants and shops near the landmarks.<br /><b>A:</b> I love a bargain.<br /><b>B:</b> You can walk around the city, but I'll also give you a subway map in case you want to take the train.<br /><b>A:</b> The subway looks scary in the movies and on TV.<br /><b>B:</b> It isn't scary at all.<br /><b>A:</b> Can I get a subway pass from you?<br /><b>B:</b> No, you'll have to buy that at the train station.<br />
<b>A:</b> You seem a little lost. Can I be of some assistance?<br /><b>B:</b> That would be nice of you. I just have one question.<br /><b>A:</b> You can ask as many as you want.<br /><b>B:</b> I just need to know where to change buses.<br /><b>A:</b> Well, where are you going? I need to know that.<br /><b>B:</b> I'm going to Beverly Hills.<br /><b>A:</b> In that case, you need to change buses in a few minutes.<br /><b>B:</b> What bus do I need to change to?<br /><b>A:</b> You're going to get off this one and get on Line 720.<br /><b>B:</b> That bus takes me to Beverly Hills?<br /><b>A:</b> Yes, right in the center of it.<br /><b>B:</b> Where do I change into the 720 bus?<br /><b>A:</b> You're going to change on Whittier Avenue.<br /><b>B:</b> Thank you, sir. You have been so helpful.<br />
<b>A:</b> Here are the books I'm returning.<br /><b>B:</b> Looks like they're late. The late fee is $5.<br /><b>A:</b> Okay, I'm only one minute late.<br /><b>B:</b> One minute late, one month late, one year late, it doesn't matter.<br /><b>A:</b> Are you kidding me? There's a big difference between one minute and one month.<br /><b>B:</b> Look, the point is - they're late.<br /><b>A:</b> Screw you! I ain't payin $5.<br /><b>B:</b> I guess you'll never borrow another book, magazine, or video here ever again.<br /><b>A:</b> It's okay, because I don't even like this library.<br /><b>B:</b> This library doesn't like you either!<br /><b>A:</b> I am leaving! You are plain rude.<br /><b>B:</b> Leave! Nobody wants to see you.<br />
<b>A:</b> Good morning. My name is Robert Stevens.<br /><b>B:</b> Good morning, Mr. Stevens. My name is Richard Jones.<br /><b>A:</b> Please have a seat, and let's get started.<br /><b>B:</b> Thank you, Mr. Stevens.<br /><b>A:</b> Please call me Robert, and I'll call you Richard. We are informal here.<br /><b>B:</b> That's good to know, Robert. Thanks.<br /><b>A:</b> I see you have two years experience. Can you tell me a little about that?<br /><b>B:</b> Oh, yes. I worked in the mailroom at Acme Corporation last year.<br /><b>A:</b> Go on, please.<br /><b>B:</b> It was a temporary job, but I gained a lot of experience.<br /><b>A:</b> Excellent! We are always looking for someone with experience.<br /><b>B:</b> I think this experience will help me blend into a job working here.<br />
<b>A:</b> Where should my hands be on the steering wheel?<br /><b>B:</b> Your hands should be on 10 and 2.<br /><b>A:</b> 10 and 2? What do you mean?<br /><b>B:</b> Think of the steering wheel as a clock, and put your hands on 10 and 2.<br /><b>A:</b> Oh, okay. What about my eyes? Should I be looking at the signs?<br /><b>B:</b> Take a quick glance at the signs, but always look in front.<br /><b>A:</b> When do I have to use my horn?<br /><b>B:</b> You should use your horn for an emergency.<br /><b>A:</b> What about if someone cuts me off?<br /><b>B:</b> That's not an appropriate use of your horn.<br /><b>A:</b> Am I ready to start driving yet?<br /><b>B:</b> No, you need to learn some more of the basics.<br />
<b>A:</b> Can you cut my hair a little differently this time?<br /><b>B:</b> Sure! How would you like it cut?<br /><b>A:</b> Well, last time it was a little too long.<br /><b>B:</b> I see what you mean. How about a bob cut?<br /><b>A:</b> Can you work some layers into it?<br /><b>B:</b> Of course! It's easy.<br /><b>A:</b> I would also like to keep some bangs.<br /><b>B:</b> How long would you like them?<br /><b>A:</b> Maybe down to my eyebrows?<br /><b>B:</b> Sounds good!<br /><b>A:</b> I trust you to make me look beautiful.<br /><b>B:</b> Oh, trust me, you'll look gorgeous!<br />
<b>A:</b> This is the first time I've ever had to do a timesheet.<br /><b>B:</b> Well, they're very easy to do.<br /><b>A:</b> You've done this before. Maybe you can help me.<br /><b>B:</b> Sure, I can help.<br /><b>A:</b> What do I need?<br /><b>B:</b> You'll need your employee number.<br /><b>A:</b> Okay, I'll look it up.<br /><b>B:</b> Once you have that, all you need to do is log your hours.<br /><b>A:</b> I have a good idea what hours I worked this week.<br /><b>B:</b> You need to be accurate.<br /><b>A:</b> It will be pretty close.<br /><b>B:</b> It must be exact. You don't want to cheat the company, or yourself.<br />
<b>A:</b> Good afternoon! This is the Beach Palace Hotel. How can I help you?<br /><b>B:</b> Do you have any rooms available for this weekend?<br /><b>A:</b> Yes. How many nights will you be staying?<br /><b>B:</b> My wife and I would like to stay for two nights.<br /><b>A:</b> Do you want a room with a view of the beach?<br /><b>B:</b> Is that more expensive?<br /><b>A:</b> The room without a view is 200 dollars a night.<br /><b>B:</b> How much is a room with a view?<br /><b>A:</b> A room with a view is $300 a night.<br /><b>B:</b> Is there a room with a partial view?<br /><b>A:</b> There is a room with an obstructed view.<br /><b>B:</b> I'll take it, but only if it's less than $300.<br />
<b>A:</b> Please have a seat.<br /><b>B:</b> Thank you.<br /><b>A:</b> I am very disappointed in you.<br /><b>B:</b> I know. Believe me, I tried very hard to make your deadline.<br /><b>A:</b> I was depending on that report.<br /><b>B:</b> I know, but unexpected circumstances came up.<br /><b>A:</b> Unexpected circumstances?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes. I would have had it ready in time, but the computer crashed.<br /><b>A:</b> The company computer crashed?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, it did. I had weeks of saved work on it when it crashed.<br /><b>A:</b> So your report was ready?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, it was. The crash deleted all my work.<br /><b>A:</b> Okay, I'll check with IT. Thanks.<br /><b>B:</b> You're welcome.<br />
<b>A:</b> What are you playing?<br /><b>B:</b> I'm playing a new game I bought yesterday.<br /><b>A:</b> Is it one of those shooting games?<br /><b>B:</b> No, it's not a shooting game.<br /><b>A:</b> Is it a sports game?<br /><b>B:</b> It's a role-playing game.<br /><b>A:</b> What's a role-playing game?<br /><b>B:</b> You play as a character and complete missions.<br /><b>A:</b> That doesn't sound too hard.<br /><b>B:</b> Some of the missions take a lot of cleverness!<br /><b>A:</b> Then I'll stick to shooting games.<br /><b>B:</b> All that'll do is kill your brain cells.<br />
<b>A:</b> I always get so emotional at weddings.<br /><b>B:</b> Me too, especially when I see the bride and groom kiss.<br /><b>A:</b> The bride looked so beautiful.<br /><b>B:</b> She did, and the groom looked so dapper in his tux.<br /><b>A:</b> I'll see you at the reception in a little bit.<br /><b>B:</b> No, you won't, because I wasn't invited.<br /><b>A:</b> Oh, I'm so sorry. Maybe your invite was lost in the mail.<br /><b>B:</b> It's okay. Why don't you bring me as your plus one?<br /><b>A:</b> Actually no, because I'm going with my husband.<br /><b>B:</b> Please take pictures so I can see how nice everyone looked.<br /><b>A:</b> I'm sure there will be pictures online afterwards.<br /><b>B:</b> It's not the same as being there.<br />
<b>A:</b> That was an excellent meal. Don't you think so, Judy?<br /><b>B:</b> Absolutely! I especially liked the dessert.<br /><b>A:</b> Yes, me too. That chocolate cake was delicious.<br /><b>B:</b> Here comes our waitress.<br /><b>A:</b> Hello again, and thank you. That was very good.<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, the dessert was delicious.<br /><b>A:</b> I would like the bill, please.<br /><b>B:</b> Her service and attitude were good also. How much are you tipping her?<br /><b>A:</b> You're right about the service. I think 20 percent.<br /><b>B:</b> Twenty percent? That's a bit high, isn't it?<br /><b>A:</b> I know, but the food was good, and the service was excellent.<br /><b>B:</b> You're right, dear. She deserves it.<br />
<b>A:</b> The first thing you want to do is fasten your seat belt.<br /><b>B:</b> Check. What's next?<br /><b>A:</b> Check your mirrors and make sure you can see behind you.<br /><b>B:</b> Done. Should I put it in reverse, now?<br /><b>A:</b> Yes, ease off the brake slowly.<br /><b>B:</b> Okay, I need to turn to leave the parking lot.<br /><b>A:</b> Make sure there are no pedestrians walking behind you.<br /><b>B:</b> Okay, do I turn the steering wheel to the left?<br /><b>A:</b> Yes, make sure you are paying attention to the cars.<br /><b>B:</b> Will do. Do I put it in drive now?<br /><b>A:</b> Yes, but remember have your foot on the brake and then ease it off.<br /><b>B:</b> Wow, this seems easy. Let's go out on the street.<br />
<b>A:</b> I'm planning to study abroad this summer.<br /><b>B:</b> Cool! Where are you going?<br /><b>A:</b> I'm going to Italy.<br /><b>B:</b> What are you studying there?<br /><b>A:</b> I'm taking a cooking class.<br /><b>B:</b> That sounds interesting.<br /><b>A:</b> I'm excited to learn in a totally new environment.<br /><b>B:</b> Italy seems beautiful.<br /><b>A:</b> It's beautiful in the pictures I've seen.<br /><b>B:</b> Take a lot when you're there.<br /><b>A:</b> I will, and I'll study hard, too.<br /><b>B:</b> Also, learn some Italian while you're there.<br />
<b>A:</b> Here are the books I'm returning.<br /><b>B:</b> Looks like they're late. The late fee is $5.<br /><b>A:</b> Okay, I'm only one minute late.<br /><b>B:</b> One minute late, one month late, one year late, it doesn't matter.<br /><b>A:</b> Are you kidding me? There's a big difference between one minute and one month.<br /><b>B:</b> Look, the point is - they're late.<br /><b>A:</b> Screw you!

You are plain rude.<br /><b>B:</b> Leave! Nobody wants to see you.<br />
<b>A:</b> What are we having for lunch?<br /><b>B:</b> I'm making some sandwiches.<br /><b>A:</b> Can I make some lemonade to drink?<br /><b>B:</b> Sure! That'd be great.<br /><b>A:</b> We just ate breakfast, but I'm already hungry.<br /><b>B:</b> Me too! It's amazing how hungry I get so soon!<br /><b>A:</b> I'm really looking forward to those sandwiches.<br /><b>B:</b> I just realized we're out of bread!<br /><b>A:</b> I guess lunch will have to be delayed.<br /><b>B:</b> Can you please go to the store and buy some?<br /><b>A:</b> Sure! Don't drink all the lemonade!<br /><b>B:</b> I won't! Come back soon. I'm starving!<br />

I hope you have enough change for the bus fare.<br /><b>A:</b> Yes, I do. Don't you worry about a thing.<br /><b>B:</b> That's good. Just put your money into the machine and take a seat.<br /><b>A:</b> It's one dollar and fifty cents for the fare, correct?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, that's correct.<br /><b>A:</b> Thank you. There you are. I told you I had enough.<br /><b>B:</b> Thank you, you're fine to sit down now.<br /><b>A:</b> Is there anywhere I can't sit?<br /><b>B:</b> The front seats hold priority for the elderly and disabled.<br />
<b>A:</b> Hi John, this is Katy.<br /><b>B:</b> It's so nice to hear your voice.<br /><b>A:</b> I just wanted to call you and thank you for the lovely time last Friday.<br /><b>B:</b> I'm glad you liked the movie.<br /><b>A:</b> The restaurant you picked was great, too.<br /><b>B:</b> I wasn't sure you'd be into Greek food.<br /><b>A:</b> I'm hoping we can do it again soon.<br /><b>B:</b> I really would like that.<br /><b>A:</b> I have tickets to a play on Saturday.<br /><b>B:</b> I really like the theater.<br /><b>A:</b> Then you'll come with me?<br /><b>B:</b> It sounds like we have a second date.<br />
<b>A:</b> Good Morning! EDD, how can I help you?<br /><b>B:</b> Hello, I recently lost my job. Can I file for unemployment?<br /><b>A:</b> Yes, you certainly can.<br /><b>B:</b> How do I file a claim?<br /><b>A:</b> The easiest way is to go online.<br /><b>B:</b> All right, I will. What's the website.<br /><b>A:</b> Just do a search for "EDD" and you will see the site.<br /><b>B:</b> I will, but what if I need help?<br /><b>A:</b> There's online help, but if you still need help, call back.<br /><b>B:</b> Okay, I will. Thank you.<br />
<b>A:</b> Can I borrow your class notes from yesterday's lecture?<br /><b>B:</b> Heck no! You're so lazy.<br /><b>A:</b> What are you talking about? I was sick yesterday.<br /><b>B:</b> I don't care. Ask someone else.<br /><b>A:</b> You're so mean!<br /><b>B:</b> I can't let anyone borrow my class notes.<br /><b>A:</b> Why not? They're just notes.<br /><b>B:</b> I let a classmate borrow my notes once, and she sold copies to people.<br /><b>A:</b> That's crazy! For how much?<br /><b>B:</b> She sold each class note set for $5.<br /><b>A:</b> Don't worry, I promise not to sell your notes.<br /><b>B:</b> I can't take your word for it.<br />

I have to get in line now.<br /><b>B:</b> What do you have to print?<br /><b>A:</b> I have to print some notes.<br /><b>B:</b> Good luck. You'll be waiting here for a long time.<br /><b>A:</b> I bet the ink and paper will go out.<br /><b>B:</b> If that happens, you're in trouble.<br />
<b>A:</b> Come inside my apartment! Make yourself feel at home.<br /><b>B:</b> Thank you for letting me visit you today.<br /><b>A:</b> It's always nice to meet extra tenants of the apartment.<br /><b>B:</b> How do you like the apartment so far?<br /><b>A:</b> I don't like it, I love it!<br /><b>B:</b> I'm glad to hear that.<br /><b>A:</b> Everybody I've met is super friendly, and the apartment is beautiful.<br /><b>B:</b> I share the exact same thoughts.<br /><b>A:</b> How long have you been a tenant here?<br /><b>B:</b> Not long. I moved in a few months ago.<br /><b>A:</b> Would you like a drink?<br /><b>B:</b> Sure, I'm kind of thirsty.<br />
<b>A:</b> Good morning, Alice. Today's the big day!<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, it is. Are we ready for this?<br /><b>A:</b> I think so. You know I've been working on the house.<br /><b>B:</b> I know, Richard. I guess I'm just nervous.<br /><b>A:</b> I wouldn't worry, babe. We've worked very hard on this.<br /><b>B:</b> Yes. I know, but still ...<br /><b>A:</b> We cleaned the house, spruced up the yard, and painted the interior.<br /><b>B:</b> I know, Richard. I'm worried about the things we didn't do.<br /><b>A:</b> I think we'll be okay. If something comes up, we'll deal with it then.<br /><b>B:</b> You think of everything.<br /><b>A:</b> No. I don't, Alice. We think of everything.<br /><b>B:</b> You're right. We'll be ready.<br />
<b>A:</b> I can't believe today is the last day of our vacation.<br /><b>B:</b> We should shop for some souvenirs to bring back home to our friends.<br /><b>A:</b> I'd much rather we spend another day seeing the sights.<br /><b>B:</b> We can sightsee and buy souvenirs along the way.<br /><b>A:</b> Why don't we just buy souvenirs at the airport?<br /><b>B:</b> The airport charges way too much for souvenirs.<br /><b>A:</b> Our friends won't know the difference.<br /><b>B:</b> We will know!<br /><b>A:</b> The hotel has postcards in the lobby, I think.<br /><b>B:</b> Postcards are to be mailed not given as souvenirs.<br /><b>A:</b> Fine! Let's go to the museum gift shop.<br /><b>B:</b> That's a great idea.<br />
<b>A:</b> Look! The bus is coming!<br /><b>B:</b> Let's see if we can cross the street in time to catch it.<br /><b>A:</b> I don't think we are going to make it.<br /><b>B:</b> You are right. There it goes.<br /><b>A:</b> When will the next bus arrive?<br /><b>B:</b> According to the bus stop pamphlet, it should arrive in about fifteen minutes.<br /><b>A:</b> We are going to be a bit late.<br /><b>B:</b> I hope our friends don't get impatient.<br /><b>A:</b> Hopefully they'll understand.<br /><b>B:</b> It should be here any moment now.<br /><b>A:</b> Look! Here it comes!<br /><b>B:</b> Get your bus pass ready to hop on board!<br />
<b>A:</b> The floor to my apartment is badly damaged.<br /><b>B:</b> I'm sorry to hear that. How bad is it?<br /><b>A:</b> It's practically falling apart.<br /><b>B:</b> Did some kind of accident cause this?<br /><b>A:</b> None that I could've made. I think your previous tenant might have caused this.<br /><b>B:</b> That makes sense. He took poor care of the apartment.<br /><b>A:</b> I could see that myself.<br /><b>B:</b> I'll have that fixed as soon as possible.<br /><b>A:</b> If it's not too much trouble, may I request one more thing?<br /><b>B:</b> Is there anything else wrong in the apartment?<br /><b>A:</b> It's just my bedroom window. I can't seem to get it open.<br /><b>B:</b> I'll have that window taken care of as well.<br />
<b>A:</b> I've run out of money for my iTunes!<br /><b>B:</b> You used it all up already?<br /><b>A:</b> I bought my favorite artists' albums today.<br /><b>B:</b> You must really like their music.<br /><b>A:</b> I do! There is no other like it.<br /><b>B:</b> Have you ever watched a live concert?<br /><b>A:</b> No, but I hope to, someday!<br /><b>B:</b> Until then, maybe you should refill your iTunes card.<br /><b>A:</b> I think I'll just use it all up again.<br /><b>B:</b> Then maybe you have all you need for now.<br /><b>A:</b> I'm going to look up her concerts on YouTube!<br /><b>B:</b> That's a better idea!<br />
<b>A:</b> Have you seen my mailbox key lying around somewhere?<br /><b>B:</b> No, I'm sorry. Where did you last leave it?<br /><b>A:</b> I thought it was in my pocket.<br /><b>B:</b> Is that where you last put it?<br /><b>A:</b> Yeah, I'm pretty sure.<br /><b>B:</b> Think hard. Where was it before you supposedly put in your pocket?<br /><b>A:</b> I was in my apartment cleaning out the kitchen.<br /><b>B:</b> Maybe you emptied your pockets while you were cleaning.<br /><b>A:</b> Wait! I think I did empty my pockets!<br /><b>B:</b> There you go. I knew it.<br /><b>A:</b> I remember now. My keys are on the kitchen counter.<br /><b>B:</b> That's a relief.<br />
<b>A:</b> Can I check in here at the curb?<br /><b>B:</b> Sure! Do you have any bags you need to check in?<br /><b>A:</b> I have one suitcase.<br /><b>B:</b> That will be $35.<br /><b>A:</b> Oh, but I paid online already.<br /><b>B:</b> Can I see your ID and I'll check for you.<br /><b>A:</b> Here is my driver's license.<br /><b>B:</b> Sorry about that. You did pay already.<br /><b>A:</b> I told you so.<br /><b>B:</b> Looks like you're leaving out of gate 12A, but check the screens inside.<br /><b>A:</b> Can my mom come with me to the gate?<br /><b>B:</b> Not unless she is flying with you.<br />
<b>A:</b> Did you hear about Joseph and Michelle?<br /><b>B:</b> No, what happened? Did they have a divorce?<br /><b>A:</b> Oh, no. They are pregnant.<br /><b>B:</b> Really? How far along is Michelle?<br /><b>A:</b> Joseph told me that she is four months.<br /><b>B:</b> Oh, okay. How is he handling the news?<br /><b>A:</b> He was a mess the last time I saw him.<br /><b>B:</b> How is he now? Is he still crazy?<br /><b>A:</b> Actually, he seems relaxed and collected.<br /><b>B:</b> I can't believe Joseph is going to be a father.<br /><b>A:</b> It's trippy, huh? He is our age.<br /><b>B:</b> This is making me feel really old.<br />
<b>A:</b> I'm calling to see if the results of some tests I took are in?<br /><b>B:</b> I can check for you. Can I have your name, please?<br /><b>A:</b> Sure, my name is Willie Foster.<br /><b>B:</b> Mr. Foster, your doctor is Dr. Edwards?<br /><b>A:</b> Yes, that's right.<br /><b>B:</b> Can you tell me when the tests were taken?<br /><b>A:</b> I was there last week.<br /><b>B:</b> I see your results are in, Mr. Foster.<br /><b>A:</b> Great! Can you read them to me?<br /><b>B:</b> Actually I cannot. You need to come in and see the doctor.<br /><b>A:</b> Are they that bad? Am I dying?<br /><b>B:</b> Sir, I'm just the receptionist. Why don't you come and speak to Dr. Edwards?<br />
<b>A:</b> I finally found an apartment to move in.<br /><b>B:</b> That's great to hear. Kudos to you.<br /><b>A:</b> Thanks, it wasn't easy finding one.<br /><b>B:</b> Are you moving in soon?<br /><b>A:</b> Yes I am. This weekend, in fact.<br /><b>B:</b> Have you hired any movers?<br /><b>A:</b> No, I have not.<br /><b>B:</b> Why not? Don't you know of any in the area?<br /><b>A:</b> That's not the problem. I don't think I have enough to afford movers.<br /><b>B:</b> That's too bad. Is there anything I could do to help?<br /><b>A:</b> Actually, I was going to ask for your help.<br /><b>B:</b> You're going to need at least one more other person to help you move.<br /><b>A:</b> You're right about that. So can I count on you to help me?<br /><b>B:</b> You bet. I would be happy to help you move.<br />
<b>A:</b> How long have we've been waiting for this bus?<br /><b>B:</b> Almost one hour. I think it's late.<br /><b>A:</b> It is late! What is taking this bus driver so long to get here?<br /><b>B:</b> Probably traffic. You know how traffic could be on the weekends.<br /><b>A:</b> That is not a good excuse. Bus drivers should know how to maneuver past traffic.<br /><b>B:</b> That's easy for you to say.<br /><b>A:</b> I just want the bus to arrive already. I want to go home.<br /><b>B:</b> It's bound to arrive any minute now.<br /><b>A:</b> I hope you're right. My patience has all extinguished.<br /><b>B:</b> Wait. I think I see it coming in the distance!<br /><b>A:</b> Thank goodness! I couldn't possibly wait another minute.<br /><b>B:</b> False alarm. It was just a truck. Sorry about that.<br />
<b>A:</b> Oh, I am so tired.<br /><b>B:</b> I know what you mean.<br /><b>A:</b> I don't know if I can continue working like this.<br /><b>B:</b> I know. I've been doing it a lot longer than you.<br /><b>A:</b> Isn't there something we can do?<br /><b>B:</b> I have complained about the double shifts before.<br /><b>A:</b> What has management told you?<br /><b>B:</b> They said they are hiring more people, and that this is temporary.<br /><b>A:</b> I need this job, but I don't like these hours at all.<br /><b>B:</b> Just hang in there. I'm sure it will change.<br /><b>A:</b> It'd better change, and the sooner the better.<br /><b>B:</b> You're right. People may start leaving.<br />
<b>A:</b> I need to report a robbery.<br /><b>B:</b> Who was robbed?<br /><b>A:</b> I was robbed.<br /><b>B:</b> I'm so sorry. When did this happen?<br /><b>A:</b> It happened 10 minutes ago.<br /><b>B:</b> Where were you robbed?<br /><b>A:</b> Right outside the bank. I had just taken money from the ATM.<br /><b>B:</b> Can you describe the person who robbed you?<br /><b>A:</b> He was wearing dark sunglasses and a Yankees baseball cap.<br /><b>B:</b> How much money did he take from you?<br /><b>A:</b> He took everything I had in my wallet.<br /><b>B:</b> You're going to have to fill out a police report.<br />
<b>A:</b> That was such a rush.<br /><b>B:</b> What did you do?<br /><b>A:</b> It was my first time voting in an election.<br /><b>B:</b> Oh wow! Congratulations, but why is that so exciting for you?<br /><b>A:</b> Are you kidding? I just played a role in history.<br /><b>B:</b> What if the incumbent wins?<br /><b>A:</b> Still, participating in U.S. democracy is great.<br /><b>B:</b> Maybe because I've done it so many times, and it doesn't seem like a big deal to me.<br /><b>A:</b> I can't wait to vote again next election.<br /><b>B:</b> Not everyone votes, so it's good that you take it seriously.<br /><b>A:</b> Everyone should take it seriously.<br /><b>B:</b> You're a great example.<br />
<b>A:</b> Hello, my name is Sally. I am hoping you could help me.<br /><b>B:</b> Of course I can, that's what I'm here for.<br /><b>A:</b> I want to look for a job, but I don't have Internet access at home.<br /><b>B:</b> That's okay, let's get started.<br /><b>A:</b> Great! What do I do first?<br /><b>B:</b> You're going to need an email address. Do you have one?<br /><b>A:</b> Yes, I have my own email.<br /><b>B:</b> Okay, I can show you a couple of good websites for jobs.<br /><b>A:</b> That would be awesome! Thanks.<br /><b>B:</b> We also have job bulletins on that table over there. You can search through those, too.<br /><b>A:</b> Well, thank you, miss. I greatly appreciate your help.<br /><b>B:</b> No problem. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask.<br />
<b>A:</b> You look lost. Are you in need of any directions?<br /><b>B:</b> I was just about to ask someone for directions. Thank you for noticing.<br /><b>A:</b> Where are you from?<br /><b>B:</b> I'm from the inner city.<br /><b>A:</b> You're a long way from home then. Are you looking for a certain street?<br /><b>B:</b> Actually, I need directions to the nearest public bus.<br /><b>A:</b> Which bus number are you looking for?<br /><b>B:</b> I'm looking for Line 267.<br /><b>A:</b> I know that bus. The stop is just around that corner.<br /><b>B:</b> Where? Over there?<br /><b>A:</b> In that direction.<br /><b>B:</b> Thank you so much. I appreciate the help.<br /><b>A:</b> You're welcome. Safe travels, my friend.<br />
<b>A:</b> I just read your proposal.<br /><b>B:</b> What did you think about it?<br /><b>A:</b> You definitely have some good ideas.<br /><b>B:</b> Well, I worked on it very hard.<br /><b>A:</b> I'm concerned about the cost, though.<br /><b>B:</b> I thought you might be. Here's a cost analysis I ran.<br /><b>A:</b> It says here that your proposal will pay for itself in a year.<br /><b>B:</b> That's what I put in the report. <br /><b>A:</b> That's impressive. If this is true, I'm certain this can work.<br /><b>B:</b> I'm quite sure it will work.<br /><b>A:</b> You have done a good job. We'll discuss this at our next meeting.<br /><b>B:</b> I appreciate your confidence in me.<br />
<b>A:</b> I hope you are on your way to vote right now.<br /><b>B:</b> I am. And I'm actually voting for you!<br /><b>A:</b> Glad to hear that. I appreciate your vote.<br /><b>B:</b> Can I ask you a question?<br /><b>A:</b> That's why I'm out here today.<br /><b>B:</b> Do you really think you can change City Hall?<br /><b>A:</b> I am sure going to try.<br /><b>B:</b> See that's the reason why you have my vote.<br /><b>A:</b> Make sure you tell a friend to vote today.<br /><b>B:</b> Should I tell them to vote for you?<br /><b>A:</b> You don't have to, but it sure would be appreciated.<br /><b>B:</b> Every vote counts.<br />
<b>A:</b> I was wondering if I could change my major from biology to political science.<br /><b>B:</b> Those majors are very different from each other.<br /><b>A:</b> I know, but I hate biology. I can't see myself studying it anymore.<br /><b>B:</b> You can change it, but you'll have to take more classes.<br /><b>A:</b> I don't mind. Political science is really interesting to me.<br /><b>B:</b> You would be graduating a year late.<br /><b>A:</b> Oh, no. I have to think a little more about this then.<br /><b>B:</b> I think you should change it, since you hate biology.<br /><b>A:</b> Yeah, you're right. I'm sorry I am so indecisive.<br /><b>B:</b> A lot of people change majors. It's normal.<br /><b>A:</b> But not as late as I did. I hate that I'm graduating after all my friends.<br /><b>B:</b> You're making the right choice.<br />
<b>A:</b> Can I please have a rum and coke?<br /><b>B:</b> You are going to have to wait until we take off and are at a cruising altitude.<br /><b>A:</b> I hate flying though, and I really need something to take the edge off.<br /><b>B:</b> I'm sorry we don't serve anything until after take-off.<br /><b>A:</b> I can pay you in cash.<br /><b>B:</b> We don't take cash on the plane anymore.<br /><b>A:</b> So how can I pay?<br /><b>B:</b> When I come around after we take off, you can pay with a debit or credit card.<br /><b>A:</b> I only have cash.<br /><b>B:</b> See if someone will buy you a drink then.<br /><b>A:</b> Can I smoke a cigarette to relax in the meantime?<br /><b>B:</b> Smoking isn't allowed on flights.<br />
<b>A:</b> Is this your first time riding the bus?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, it is. How did you tell?<br /><b>A:</b> The look on your face gave it away.<br /><b>B:</b> I really do look that confused?<br /><b>A:</b> I'm sorry to say so, but don't be embarrassed.<br /><b>B:</b> You seem friendly. Would you mind answering a question?<br /><b>A:</b> No, not at all. What's your question?<br /><b>B:</b> I'm trying to get to the airport. Do you know where I should get off?<br /><b>A:</b> This bus actually drops you off right in front of the airport.<br /><b>B:</b> I know that it does. I've just forgotten on what street.<br /><b>A:</b> The stop will say LAX Airport.<br /><b>B:</b> Oh, really. That's pretty obvious.<br />
<b>A:</b> Do you have your customs form?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, I filled it out on the plane.<br /><b>A:</b> I also need your passport.<br /><b>B:</b> I'm a U.S. citizen.<br /><b>A:</b> I still need to see your passport.<br /><b>B:</b> What other documents do you need?<br /><b>A:</b> Do you have anything to declare?<br /><b>B:</b> I bought some leather wallets in Morocco.<br /><b>A:</b> You're going to have to show them to me.<br /><b>B:</b> Are you going to take then away from me?<br /><b>A:</b> I'll only confiscate them if they are made of python skin.<br /><b>B:</b> They are just leather wallets.<br />
<b>A:</b> What are you playing?<br /><b>B:</b> I'm playing a new game I bought yesterday.<br /><b>A:</b> Is it one of those shooting games?<br /><b>B:</b> No, it's not a shooting game.<br /><b>A:</b> Is it a sports game?<br /><b>B:</b> It's a role-playing game.<br /><b>A:</b> What's a role-playing game?<br /><b>B:</b> You play as a character and complete missions.<br /><b>A:</b> That doesn't sound too hard.<br /><b>B:</b> Some of the missions take a lot of cleverness!<br /><b>A:</b> Then I'll stick to shooting games.<br /><b>B:</b> All that'll do is kill your brain cells.<br />
<b>A:</b> Wow! Our order is sure taking long.<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, it is. It's been nearly 45 minutes now.<br /><b>A:</b> Well, maybe they're just very busy.<br /><b>B:</b> I don't know, dear. I was watching our waiter.<br /><b>A:</b> What did you see?<br /><b>B:</b> He actually handed in orders for two tables before us.<br /><b>A:</b> You mean after he took our order.<br /><b>B:</b> Yes. He was goofing off. I could see him from here.<br /><b>A:</b> How do you know he did this.<br /><b>B:</b> Like I said, I was watching. He forgot our order.<br /><b>A:</b> That's terrible.<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, well he's not going to get a good tip from me.<br />
<b>A:</b> Do you ever take public transportation to get around?<br /><b>B:</b> Before I frequently did. Not so much anymore. Why do you ask?<br /><b>A:</b> I wanted some information about the public transportation that is available in the city.<br /><b>B:</b> I could provide you with some. What would you like to know?<br /><b>A:</b> What kind of public transportation is there?<br /><b>B:</b> There is a local shuttle bus that could take you almost anywhere in the city.<br /><b>A:</b> It does not take you outside the city?<br /><b>B:</b> Unfortunately it does not. But it's cheaper than other public buses that do.<br /><b>A:</b> I see. And where is the nearest stop from here?<br /><b>B:</b> It's really close. Just a block away towards that direction.<br /><b>A:</b> That way? I see. Thank you.<br /><b>B:</b> You can't miss it, and you're welcome.<br />
<b>A:</b> Did you book the hotel for the trip?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes and it comes with something extra!<br /><b>A:</b> What would that be, exactly?<br /><b>B:</b> Continental breakfast every morning!<br /><b>A:</b> Wow! Do you think they serve pancakes?<br /><b>B:</b> Oh, with syrup and fresh fruit.<br /><b>A:</b> You can't forget the whipped cream!<br /><b>B:</b> And freshly brewed coffee!<br /><b>A:</b> I can't wait to see it all!<br /><b>B:</b> I think I'm more excited for breakfast than the trip.<br /><b>A:</b> Well, breakfast is the most important meal of the day.<br /><b>B:</b> That's very true.<br />
<b>A:</b> I wonder what I can do to get involved in the campaign?<br /><b>B:</b> You can volunteer.<br /><b>A:</b> What does a campaign volunteer do?<br /><b>B:</b> All kinds of things like handing out pamphlets.<br /><b>A:</b> Pamphlets about what?<br /><b>B:</b> About the candidate and what they stand for.<br /><b>A:</b> That sounds like it would be a great way to meet people.<br /><b>B:</b> It is. Volunteers also make phone calls and ask for money.<br /><b>A:</b> I would feel awkward asking strangers for money.<br /><b>B:</b> It's not for you. It's for your candidate.<br /><b>A:</b> You have a point.<br /><b>B:</b> Volunteering for a campaign is a great experience.<br />
<b>A:</b> Can I have a minute?<br /><b>B:</b> What is going on?<br /><b>A:</b> I'm really not feeling very well this afternoon.<br /><b>B:</b> Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that.<br /><b>A:</b> Do you think I can leave the office early?<br /><b>B:</b> Well, I have some medication here on my desk.<br /><b>A:</b> I already took some pills and they really aren't helping.<br /><b>B:</b> It's just that we have the report due today.<br /><b>A:</b> I already gave Dennis what I have so far.<br /><b>B:</b> He knows how to finish it?<br /><b>A:</b> I emailed him detailed instructions.<br /><b>B:</b> All right, go home then, but leave your phone on so we can call you if we have questions.<br />
<b>A:</b> I missed my connecting flight to Washington D.C.<br /><b>B:</b> How did you miss your flight?<br /><b>A:</b> I was sitting in the airport bar and I lost track of time.<br /><b>B:</b> Well, that's not really our fault.<br /><b>A:</b> Fine, but what can you do for me?<br /><b>B:</b> I can put you on the stand-by list.<br /><b>A:</b> What does that mean?<br /><b>B:</b> It means that if there are empty seats on the next flight out, you can get on.<br /><b>A:</b> What if there are no seats?<br /><b>B:</b> You can buy another ticket.<br /><b>A:</b> I didn't even buy the first ticket.<br /><b>B:</b> I guess you have to buy a ticket.<br />
<b>A:</b> Thank you for calling Eagle Airline.<br /><b>B:</b> I would like to book a round trip flight from Los Angeles to New York City<br /><b>A:</b> What date do you want to leave Los Angeles?<br /><b>B:</b> I want to leave on September 1st.<br /><b>A:</b> Do you prefer a morning flight?<br /><b>B:</b> Can you get me on a red-eye out of LAX?<br /><b>A:</b> I can book you on an overnight flight that will get you into New York City at 6 a.m.<br /><b>B:</b> Make sure I land in JFK not LaGuardia airport<br /><b>A:</b> Okay, so I have you on an overnight flight from Los Angeles International Airport leaving at 10 p.m. to JFK.<br /><b>B:</b> I don't want to have anyone climbing over me to use the bathroom while I sleep, so I want a window seat.<br /><b>A:</b> I will put you in window seat 13A.<br /><b>B:</b> Make sure that isn't an exit row because I don't want to have to help in an emergency.<br />
<b>A:</b> I need new clothes.<br /><b>B:</b> What kinds of new clothes?<br /><b>A:</b> I want something stylish.<br /><b>B:</b> What do you want new clothes for?<br /><b>A:</b> Well, school starts again in a week.<br /><b>B:</b> Looking good costs money, though.<br /><b>A:</b> I know what you mean.<br /><b>B:</b> The stuff you're looking for is expensive.<br /><b>A:</b> Yeah, I don't have much money.<br /><b>B:</b> Maybe you should try bargain shopping.<br /><b>A:</b> That sounds like something my mom would do.<br /><b>B:</b> Hey, moms are good at saving money.<br />
<b>A:</b> Is this Gage Avenue?<br /><b>B:</b> No, this is Florence Avenue.<br /><b>A:</b> Oh, no. I must've gotten off the bus too early.<br /><b>B:</b> Don't worry. We all make mistakes.<br /><b>A:</b> Thank you for that.<br /><b>B:</b> Maybe I can help you get to where you're going.<br /><b>A:</b> Are you sure it wouldn't be any trouble?<br /><b>B:</b> No trouble at all.<br /><b>A:</b> How much further is Gage Avenue?<br /><b>B:</b> Not too far. It's a fifteen-minute walk from here.<br /><b>A:</b> Can you please point me towards the right direction?<br /><b>B:</b> Sure. You're going to head south from here.<br /><b>A:</b> South is that way?<br /><b>B:</b> No that's north. South is the opposite way.<br />
<b>A:</b> I think this new place will work out great.<br /><b>B:</b> Why do you say that, Dan?<br /><b>A:</b> It seems there's so much nearby.<br /><b>B:</b> Like what, baby?<br /><b>A:</b> Didn't you see all the grocery stores?<br /><b>B:</b> I saw a couple.<br /><b>A:</b> There are lots of them, and some specialty shops.<br /><b>B:</b> That's great. Like what?<br /><b>A:</b> I saw a produce stand, and a butcher market next to each other.<br /><b>B:</b> Where was that?<br /><b>A:</b> Not far. I'll take you later.<br /><b>B:</b> That sounds great. I look forward to it.<br />
<b>A:</b> It's time to go, Richard.<br /><b>B:</b> Okay, Patty. I'm ready.<br /><b>A:</b> I'm really stoked about this new school. Judy is going to love it.<br /><b>B:</b> I know. I've heard so many good things about it.<br /><b>A:</b> Did you make an appointment?<br /><b>B:</b> No, it wasn't necessary. They're enrolling new students this week.<br /><b>A:</b> Okay, I just hope there're not too many people.<br /><b>B:</b> I think we'll be okay. There're not too many cars in the lot.<br /><b>A:</b> I'm glad we brought her transcripts. I think that will make this smoother.<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, I'm sure it will. That was a good idea.<br /><b>A:</b> Okay, let's get this done.<br /><b>B:</b> I'm ready, babe.<br />
<b>A:</b> Help, please. My key won't open the front door to my apartment.<br /><b>B:</b> Oh, no. Let me try to help you.<br /><b>A:</b> Thank you, but I don't think there's much you can do.<br /><b>B:</b> Don't be so pessimistic. I'll help you unlock that door.<br /><b>A:</b> I already tried using the key. There's no use in trying anymore.<br /><b>B:</b> I have another idea. Care to hear it?<br /><b>A:</b> Alright, I don't have any other options.<br /><b>B:</b> Let me drive you to a locksmith.<br /><b>A:</b> What good will that do?<br /><b>B:</b> A locksmith can replace your key. The one you have now is probably broken.<br /><b>A:</b> It's worth a try, I guess.<br /><b>B:</b> There's the spirit! Come on, let's go.<br />
<b>A:</b> Good morning. My name is Robert Stevens.<br /><b>B:</b> Good morning, Mr. Stevens. My name is Richard Jones.<br /><b>A:</b> Please have a seat, and let's get started.<br /><b>B:</b> Thank you, Mr. Stevens.<br /><b>A:</b> Please call me Robert, and I'll call you Richard. We are informal here.<br /><b>B:</b> That's good to know, Robert. Thanks.<br /><b>A:</b> I see you have two years experience. Can you tell me a little about that?<br /><b>B:</b> Oh, yes. I worked in the mailroom at Acme Corporation last year.<br /><b>A:</b> Go on, please.<br /><b>B:</b> It was a temporary job, but I gained a lot of experience.<br /><b>A:</b> Excellent! We are always looking for someone with experience.<br /><b>B:</b> I think this experience will help me blend into a job working here.<br />
<b>A:</b> I just got off the phone with the EDD.<br /><b>B:</b> What did they say? Are you going to get benefits?<br /><b>A:</b> Yes, but not as much as I thought.<br /><b>B:</b> What do you mean?<br /><b>A:</b> I thought I would receive a certain amount per month, but I got less.<br /><b>B:</b> Why is that?<br /><b>A:</b> I'm not really sure. It has something to do with how much I earned.<br /><b>B:</b> They pay benefits based on your income?<br /><b>A:</b> Yes. I think the more you earn, the more you receive.<br /><b>B:</b> That's interesting. I didn't know that.<br /><b>A:</b> I think I may go to the EDD office to ask about it.<br /><b>B:</b> You should go. What have you got to lose?<br />
<b>A:</b> Do you know which bus will get me from Maywood to Cal State LA?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes, I do. You'll need to take two buses.<br /><b>A:</b> Which bus should I take first?<br /><b>B:</b> You'll need to take the 260 on Atlantic all the way to Garvey.<br /><b>A:</b> Which bus do I take after that?<br /><b>B:</b> You'll have to take the 70 bus.<br /><b>A:</b> Will I find the 70 bus stop immediately?<br /><b>B:</b> Yes. You'll find it right across the street after you get off the 260.<br /><b>A:</b> How long might the whole trip take?<br /><b>B:</b> It might take you about 40 minutes to an hour depending on traffic.<br /><b>A:</b> Alright. Thank you very much.<br /><b>B:</b> You're welcome. Glad I could help.<br />
<b>A:</b> I don't think I'll be in town on Election Day.<br /><b>B:</b> You can still vote though.<br /><b>A:</b> How can I vote if I won't be here?<br /><b>B:</b> You can file an absentee ballot.<br /><b>A:</b> How do I do that?<br /><b>B:</b> You can ask for a mail-in ballot.<br /><b>A:</b> What is that?<br /><b>B:</b> It's a form you mail in saying who you want to vote for.<br /><b>A:</b> Does it count like a regular ballot?<br /><b>B:</b> It's just as if you were voting in person.<br /><b>A:</b> I'd better ask for one then.<br /><b>B:</b> You should do it quickly since it has to be in a week before Election Day.<br />
<b>A:</b> Why do you have so many full trash bags?<br /><b>B:</b> I had a party last night. I'm cleaning up now and tossing them away.<br /><b>A:</b> Wait! What are you doing?<br /><b>B:</b> Throwing these bags into the trash can. Why do you seem concerned?<br /><b>A:</b> Did you divide the recyclables from the trash?<br /><b>B:</b> No, I didn't. I was a bit lazy to do so.<br /><b>A:</b> Don't be lazy. You should do your part in helping the environment.<br /><b>B:</b> You're right. It's going to be messy though. Mind giving me a hand?<br /><b>A:</b> Sure. I'd be glad to.<br /><b>B:</b> Thank you. This is a lot to handle alone.<br /><b>A:</b> Don't mention it. After all, one person can make a big difference to the environment.<br /><b>B:</b> I'll be sure to be more considerate next time.<br />
<b>A:</b> What a great day to be at the beach.<br /><b>B:</b> I love the smell of the salt-water air.<br /><b>A:</b> Are you going to go swimming in that water?<br /><b>B:</b> You bet. I'm going into the ocean.<br /><b>A:</b> I actually hate swimming in the ocean.<br /><b>B:</b> Why do you like the beach then?<br /><b>A:</b> I like people watching.<br /><b>B:</b> Do you like doing that at the pool?<br /><b>A:</b> Yes, but when I go to the pool, I actually swim.<br /><b>B:</b> So I guess you won't go surfing with me.<br /><b>A:</b> Nope, but I'll cheer for you from my beach towel.<br /><b>B:</b> I'd rather do something together like making a sand castle.<br />
<b>A:</b> I think your grading policy is unfair.<br /><b>B:</b> I beg your pardon?!<br /><b>A:</b> Why is a 90% a B?<br /><b>B:</b> I'm trying to challenge you guys.<br /><b>A:</b> That's not a challenge, that's a punishment.<br /><b>B:</b> I've had this policy since I started teaching.<br /><b>A:</b> It's time for a change.<br /><b>B:</b> I'm not changing my policy because you don't like it.<br /><b>A:</b> Put yourself in my shoes.<br /><b>B:</b> I have been a student once, and I think my policy is fair.<br /><b>A:</b> I'm going to drop your class!<br /><b>B:</b> Go ahead!

<b>A:</b> Have you checked your smoke detectors recently?<br /><b>B:</b> No, I wasn't even aware we had smoke detectors.<br /><b>A:</b> All the apartments are equipped with them. It's an essential safety feature.<br /><b>B:</b> How do you check if they're working?<br /><b>A:</b> It's real easy. If you like, I could show you.<br /><b>B:</b> That would be nice of you.<br /><b>A:</b> Are you doing anything right now?<br /><b>B:</b> No. It's my day off work.<br /><b>A:</b> How about I come over and show you how to check them?<br /><b>B:</b> Sounds good. Come inside.<br /><b>A:</b> It's really easy to check them. Just grab one from the wall, and check the battery in the back.<br /><b>B:</b> What does this light mean?<br /><b>A:</b> If you see the light, that means it's functioning.<br /><b>B:</b> So I don't need to replace the battery. Thank you so much.<br />
<b>A:</b> Good morning, Peterson Industries.<br /><b>B:</b> Hello, Betty. This is Roger.<br /><b>A:</b> Hey, Roger. Where are you?<br /><b>B:</b> I am stuck on the 60 freeway. I'm going to be late for work.<br /><b>A:</b> Oh, no. Any traffic accident happened?<br /><b>B:</b> I really don't know, Betty. All I know is that traffic is crawling.<br /><b>A:</b> I will tell your supervisor you called in late.<br /><b>B:</b> That would be great, but I could tell him myself.<br /><b>A:</b> Well, normally that would be okay, but he's stuck in the same traffic jam.<br /><b>B:</b> Oh no!

<b>A:</b> I would like to reserve The Hunger Games. <br /><b>B:</b> Everyone wants to reserve that book these days.<br /><b>A:</b> It's really popular, because the movie just came out.<br /><b>B:</b> You have to pay $1 to reserve the book.<br /><b>A:</b> What?! That's ridiculous.<br /><b>B:</b> Like you said, it's popular.<br /><b>A:</b> I have to think about it then.<br /><b>B:</b> I personally think $1 is nothing. It's cheaper than buying the book.<br /><b>A:</b> How much is the book?<br /><b>B:</b> On the back, it says it's $15. It depends on the bookstore you go to though.<br /><b>A:</b> Fine, I'll give you a $1.<br /><b>B:</b> You won't regret it! The book is really good.<br />

You might not like what you see.<br /><b>A:</b> He wrote such boring things about me. <br /><b>B:</b> What did he write?<br /><b>A:</b> Just that I'm a diligent student who does well.<br /><b>B:</b> At least it was nothing bad. You can always ask another professor.<br /><b>A:</b> I know, but I don't have time.<br /><b>B:</b> When do you need another recommendation letter by?<br /><b>A:</b> I need one by this Friday.<br /><b>B:</b> Oh, wow!

I guess we spend a lot of time there.<br /><b>A:</b> We do. Everyone does.<br /><b>B:</b> Okay, what should we do first?<br /><b>A:</b> How about the cabinets? They're not too expensive, and it will look good.<br /><b>B:</b> Sounds good to me. I'll start looking into it tomorrow.<br />

You can do it.<br /><b>B:</b> If I accidentally burn the house down, it's not my fault.<br />

I didn't know that.<br /><b>A:</b> I think I may go to the EDD office to ask about it.<br /><b>B:</b> You should go. What have you got to lose?<br />

Listen, I have a few questions about taking the bus.<br /><b>B:</b> What are they? I'm sure I could answer them for you.<br /><b>A:</b> I was wondering how often the buses pass by.<br /><b>B:</b> They usually pass by every thirty minutes, but it could vary.<br />
